# Control AKS cluster access using Azure RBAC with Azure AD in AKS hybrid (Preview)

This article describes how to set up Azure RBAC on an AKS cluster with Azure Arc enabled so you can use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and role assignments to control authorization checks on the cluster in AKS hybrid. Before you begin, you'll need to create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with Azure Arc enabled. Steps for creating the cluster are covered in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

For more information about using Azure RBAC with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters, see [Azure RBAC on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/conceptual-azure-rbac).

Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis.<!--REVIEW! Source: azure-rbac.md, loosely adapted for AKS hybrid.-->

## Prerequisites

Before deploying an Azure Arc enabled AKS Hybrid cluster, the following prerequisites must be met:

#### Prepare your network

Configure the following network, proxy, and/or firewall settings:

- Configure the endpoints that must be accessible to connect a cluster to Azure Arc. For a list, see [Meet network requirements](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/quickstart-connect-cluster?tabs=azure-cli#meet-network-requirements).  

- Allow the (https://graph.microsoft.com)[https://graph.microsoft.com] endpoint in your proxy or firewall. 

  For information about configuring a proxy server, see [Proxy server settings](/azure/aks/hybrid/set-proxy-settings).

### Create the server app and client app

Register your server app and secret and your client app and secret by performing the following steps:

> [!NOTE]
> These steps direct you to key tasks in [Use Azure RBAC for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/azure-rbac) that are required to prepare for the Azure RBAC setup in AKS hybrid.  

To do these steps, you must have the built-in [Application Administrator role](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) in Azure AD. For instructions, see [Assign Azure AD roles to users](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal).

1. [Create a server application and shared secret](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/azure-rbac?tabs=AzureCLI#create-a-server-application).

1. [Create a role assignment for the server application](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/azure-rbac?tabs=AzureCLI#create-a-role-assignment-for-the-server-application).

1. [Create a client application](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/azure-rbac?tabs=AzureCLI#create-a-client-application). You'll refer to the client application when you use `kubectl` to connect within your network.

#### Grant permissions for users on the cluster

Assign roles to grant permissions to users of service principal names (SPNs) on the cluster. Use the `az role assignment` command.

To assign roles on an AKS cluster, you must have **Owner** permission on the subscription, resource group, or cluster.

The following example uses [az role assignment](/cli/azure/role/assignment?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true) to assign the `Azure Arc Kubernetes Cluster Admin` role to the resource group that will contain the cluster. You can set the scope of the resource group before you create the cluster.

```azurecli
az role assignment create --role "Azure Arc Kubernetes Cluster Admin" --assignee xyz@contoso.com --scope /subscriptions/<subscription id>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters/<resource name, aka name of AKS cluster>
```

To get the scope ID for the cluster or resource group, run the following commands, and use `"id":property`:

```azurecli
az connectedk8s show -g <name of resource group>  
az connectedk8s show -n <name of cluster> -g <name of resource group>
```

For other examples, see [az role assignment](/cli/azure/role/assignment?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true).

For information about pre-built Azure RBAC roles for Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters, see [Create role assignments for users to access a cluster](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/azure-rbac?tabs=AzureCLI#create-role-assignments-for-users-to-access-the-cluster). For a list of all available built-in roles, see [Azure built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

## 1. Create an SPN and assign permissions

<!--Stopped editing here, 11/30. Edit numbered procedures tomorrow.-->

To set up an automation account to create target clusters that have Azure RBAC enabled in AKS hybrid, use an Azure service principal.

Follow these steps to create a service principal (SPN) and assign permissions to it:

The command used to do that is: az ad sp create-for-rbac, this command To create a service principal and configure it with the required permission for creating an Azure RBAC-enabled AKS hybrid cluster, use the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command. For command information, see [az ad sp](/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true) to the URL).

Creating a target cluster doesn't require high privilege on the subscription. We recommend using the **Kubernetes Cluster - Azure Arc Onboarding** role. You can also use the **Owner** or **Contributor** role. For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

Example (Azure CLI):

```azurecli
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role "Kubernetes Cluster - Azure Arc Onboarding" --scopes /subscriptions/< OID of the SPN > 
```

For more information about creating an SPN and assigning it a role, see [Create an Azure service principal](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli).

The output of this command will be "Creating 'Kubernetes Cluster - Azure Arc Onboarding' role assignment" under the **/subscriptions/<OID pf the SPN** scope.

The output includes credentials that you must protect. Be sure not to include these credentials in your code or check the credentials into your source control. For more information, see [Create an Azure service principal](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli).

## 2. Create the credential object  

Open a PowerShell window, and run the following command:

```powershell
$Credential = Get-Credential
```

The command prompts for a password.

For automation scripts, see [Get-Credential, Example 4](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential?view=powershell-7.3&preserve-view=true to the URL#example-4).

## 3. Create Azure RBAC-enabled AKS target cluster using an SPN

Before you can create the AKS target cluster, you must [Create an SPN](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli).

To creata an Azure RBAC-enabled target cluster in AKS hybrid, open a PowerShell window, and run the following command. The command must be executed on the Azure HCI node or Windows server where target you'll deploy the cluster.

```powershell
New-AksHciCluster -name â€œ<cluster name>"  -enableAzureRBAC -resourceGroup "<name of resource group>" -subscriptionID "<subscription id>" -tenantId "<tenant id>" -credential $Credential -location "eastus" -appId $SERVER_APP_ID -appSecret $SERVER_APP_SECRET -aadClientId $CLIENT_APP_ID -nodePoolName <name of node pool> 
```

## 4. Create Azure RBAC-enabled AKS target cluster interactively

To create your Azure RBAC-enabled target cluster interactively, run this command in a PowerShell session on the Azure HCI node or Windows server where you'll deploy the cluster:

```powershell
New-AksHciCluster -name "<cluster name>"  -enableAzureRBAC -resourceGroup "<name of resource group>"  -location "eastus" -appId $SERVER_APP_ID -appSecret $SERVER_APP_SECRET -aadClientId $CLIENT_APP_ID -nodePoolName <name of node pool> 
```

1. Run this command in PowerShell on the Azure HCI node or Windows server where you'll deploy the cluster.

2. Sign in to Azure via PowerShell using the `connect-azaccount -deviceauth` command. The command prompts for authentication via the device code flow.

3. Set subscription context to the subscription where the target cluster will be created by running this command:

   ```powershell
   az account set --subscription "subscriptionName"
   ```

This completes the Azure RBAC setup on the AKS cluster.

## Connect to AKS cluster via Azure RBAC

With the Azure RBAC setup complete, Azure RBAC will authenticate connections to the cluster. The procedures in this section describe how to [use the `connectedk8s` proxy method to connect to an AKS cluster from anywhere on the Internet](#connect-to-aks-cluster-from-internet-using-connectedk8s-proxy-method) and how to [connect over a private network](#connect-to-aks-cluster-over-a-private-network).

### Connect to AKS cluster from Internet using `connectedk8s` proxy method

Use the `connectedk8s` proxy method to send an authentication/authorization request from anywhere on the Internet. When you use this method, you're limited to 200 groups.

To connect to an AKS cluster using the `connectedk8s` proxy method:

1. Open an Azure CLI window, and use`az login` to connect to Azure. For more information, see [Sign in with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

1. Set the subscription for your account to the subscription you used to create the AKS cluster:<!--VERIFY. Just guessing.-->

   ```azurecli
   az account set -subscription "<mySubscription>" 
   ```

1. Confirm that you're connected to Azure:

   ```azurecli
   az account show
   ```

1. Start the proxy process by running the following command:

   ```azurecli
   az connectedk8s proxy -n <cluster name> -g <resource group name>
   ```

1. Make sure authentication is working correctly by sending requests to the cluster. Leaving the terminal that you connected from open, open another tab, and send the requests to the cluster. You should get responses based on your Azure RBAC configuration.

1. Press **Ctrl+C** to close the `connectedk8s` proxy connection.

### Connect to AKS cluster over a private network

When you connect to an AKS cluster over a private network, there's no limit the on number of groups you can use.

To connect to an AKS cluster over a private network, do the following steps:

1. Open a PowerShell window **WHERE? WHAT CREDENTIALS?**.

1. Download the **kubeconfig** file by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Get-AksHciCredential -Name <cluster name> -aadauth
   ```

1. Start sending requests to AKS API server by running the `kubectl` `api-server` command. **ADD A COMMAND EXAMPLE?**

   You'll get a warning message. You can ignore it.
