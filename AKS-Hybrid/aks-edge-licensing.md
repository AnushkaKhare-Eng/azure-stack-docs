# AKS Edge Essentials licensing options

AKS Edge Essentials can be licensed using one of the following options:

- Azure subscription-based model
- Volume licensing model (available from April 2023)

## Azure subscription-based model (coming soon)

You are entitled to commercially use AKS Edge Essentials, provided you connect your Kubernetes clusters to Azure using Azure Arc. The agent required for Azure Arc is included within the AKS Edge Essentials MSI and included PowerShell commands, to easily connect your cluster to Arc.  

## Volume licensing based model (available in April 2023)

You are entitled to commercially use AKS Edge Essentials once you have purchased the required number of licenses via the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC). We will share more details once we are ready to launch this program.
