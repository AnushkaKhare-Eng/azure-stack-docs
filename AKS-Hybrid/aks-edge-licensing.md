# AKS Edge Essentials licensing options

AKS Edge Essentials can be licensed using one of the following options:

- Azure subscription-based model
- Volume licensing model (available starting April 2023)

## Azure subscription-based model

You're entitled to commercially use AKS Edge Essentials, provided you connect your Kubernetes clusters to Azure using Azure Arc. AKS Edge Essentials includes both the agent required to connect to Azure Arc and corresponding PowerShell commands, to easily connect your cluster to Arc.  

## Volume licensing based model (available in April 2023)

You're entitled to commercially use AKS Edge Essentials once you've purchased the required number of licenses via the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC). We'll share more details once we're ready to launch this program.
