# Can't fully delete AKS Arc cluster with PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) resources

[!INCLUDE [hci-applies-to-23h2](includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

When you delete an AKS Arc cluster that has [PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) (PDB) resources, the deletion might fail to remove the PDB resources. By default, PDB is installed in the workload identity-enabled AKS Arc cluster.

## Workaround

Before you delete the AKS Arc cluster, access the AKS Arc cluster's **kubeconfig** and delete all the PDB:

1. Access the AKS Arc cluster:

   ```azurecli
   az connectedk8s proxy -n $aks_cluster_name -g $resource_group_name 
   ```

1. Verify PDB:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pdb -A 
   ```

1. Delete all the PDB:

    ```bash
    kubectl delete pdb azure-wi-webhook-controller-manager -n arc-workload-identity 
    ```

1. Delete the AKS Arc cluster:

    ```azurecli
    az aksarc delete -n $aks_cluster_name -g $resource_group_name
    ```
