Based on customer feedback, we have updated the AKS evaluation guide to reflect changes in the product and provide a better end-to-end experience that is closer to real-life use case scenarios. [**Jumpstart HCIBox**](https://aka.ms/jumpstarthcibox) is a turnkey solution that provides a complete sandbox for exploring AKS enabled by Arc, Azure Stack HCI capabilities, and hybrid cloud integration in a virtualized environment. HCIBox is designed to be completely self-contained within a single Azure subscription and resource group, which makes it easy for you to get hands-on with AKS, Azure Stack HCI, and Azure Arc technology without the need for physical hardware.

To access the Jumpstart HCIBox experience, [navigate to this link and follow the deployment instructions](https://aka.ms/jumpstarthcibox).

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you delete all resources created with the previous version of the evaluation guide experience, to avoid conflicts and extra cost due to the size of the virtual machines created.
