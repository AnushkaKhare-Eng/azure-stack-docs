This template provides the basic structure of a Concept article pattern. See the [instructions - Concept](../level4/article-concept.md) in the pattern library.

Concept is an article pattern that defines what something is or explains an abstract idea.

There are several situations that might call for writing a Concept article, including:

* If there's a new idea that's central to a service or product, that idea must be explained so that customers understand the value of the service or product as it relates to their circumstances. A good recent example is the concept of containerization or the concept of scalability.
* If there's optional information or explanations that are common to several Tutorials or How-to guides, this information can be consolidated and single-sourced in a full-bodied Concept article for you to reference.
* If a service or product is extensible, advanced users might modify it to better suit their application. It's better that advanced users fully understand the reasoning behind the design choices and everything else "under the hood" so that their variants are more robust, thereby improving their experience.

<!-- 1. H1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required. Set expectations for what the content covers, so customers know the content meets their needs. The H1 should NOT begin with a verb.

Reflect the concept that undergirds an action, not the action itself. The H1 must start with:

* "\<noun phrase\> concept(s)", or
* "What is \<noun\>?", or
* "\<noun\> overview"

Concept articles are primarily distinguished by what they aren't:

* They aren't procedural articles. They don't show how to complete a task.
* They don't have specific end states, other than conveying an underlying idea, and don't have concrete, sequential actions for the user to take.

One clear sign of a procedural article would be the use of a numbered list. With rare exception, numbered lists shouldn't appear in Concept articles.

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph
----------------------------------------------------------

Required. Lead with a light intro that describes what the article covers. Answer the fundamental “why would I want to know this?” question. Keep it short.

* Answer the fundamental "Why do I want this knowledge?" question.
* Don't start the article with a bunch of notes or caveats.
* Don’t link away from the article in the introduction.
* For definitive concepts, it's better to lead with a sentence in the form, "X is a (type of) Y that does Z."

The adaptive cloud approach unifies siloed teams, distributed sites, and sprawling systems into a single operations, security, application, and data model, enabling organizations to leverage cloud-native and AI technologies to work simultaneously across hybrid, multicloud, edge, and IoT.

<!-- 5. Next step/Related content ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Optional: You have two options for manually curated links in this pattern: Next step and Related content. You don't have to use either, but don't use both.
  - For Next step, provide one link to the next step in a sequence. Use the blue box format
  - For Related content provide 1-3 links. Include some context so the customer can determine why they would click the link. Add a context sentence for the following links.

TODO: Add your next step link(s)
