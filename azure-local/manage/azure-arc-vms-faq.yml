    questions:
    
    - question: |
        How do I upgrade my VM management infrastructure components?
      answer: |
        Updates for VM management infrastructure components like MOC, Azure Arc resource bridge, and Kubernetes extensions on Azure Local 2311.2 or later are handled automatically. For more information, see [Update overview for Azure Local](../update/about-updates-23h2.md).

    - question: | 
        Will I be charged when updating my VM using the Azure Update Manager service?
      answer: |
        No. You can update VMs for free when using the Azure Update Manager service. However, updating unmanaged VMs created using Windows Admin Center or Hyper-V Manager, and Arc-enabled independently (these are now Arc-enabled servers), will incur a charge. For more information, see [Azure Update Manager Pricing for Arc-enabled servers](
        /azure/update-manager/update-manager-faq#pricing).
        
    - question: |
        Why do I need to move to Azure Local?
      answer: |
        Moving to Azure Local is essential to continue using Azure Local VM management since version 22H2 will no longer be supported after 15 February 2024. Azure Local has several new and enhanced features that ensure that you have access to a more stable, efficient, and feature-rich platform.

    - question: |
        How can I seek assistance during the transition to Azure Local?
      answer: |
        The Microsoft Support team is available to help you through the transition and can answer any questions you might have. Feel free to reach out for assistance via the Azure portal.

        You can also learn more about upgrading at [About Azure Local upgrades](../upgrade/about-upgrades-23h2.md).

    - question: |
        Can Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Local and Windows Server and Azure Arc resource bridge coexist on the same Azure Local instance?
      answer: |
        Yes. Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Local and Windows Server and VM provisioning from the Azure portal can be deployed on the same Azure Local instance. You can deploy the AKS-HCI management system first and then Azure Arc resource bridge. In this configuration, uninstalling Azure Kubernetes Service from Azure Local removes Azure Arc resource bridge.
    
    - question: |
        I used to be able to create virtual networks for my VMs in past releases. Starting 2310 (November 2023), I can only create logical networks. What changed?
      answer: |
        Starting with the 2311.2 release Azure Local, logical networks have replaced virtual networks. Logical networks are the Azure resources that represent your physical network. To connect virtual machines to your network, you need to create logical networks on which you can place your VM network interfaces. Virtual networks created on earlier versions cannot be used with the Azure Local 2311.2 release and later, and need to be manually deleted.

    - question: |
        Can I use SDN for Azure Local VMs created from the Azure portal?
      answer: |
        SDN is currently not supported for VMs created from the Azure portal. For more information on using SDN in Azure Local, see [SDN in Azure Local](sdn-technical-reference.md).

    - question: |
        How can I perform live migration of Azure Local virtual machines?
      answer: |
        Live migration of VMs across Azure Local machines is supported via on-premises tools like [Failover Cluster Manager](/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/use/manage-failover-clusters#adding-a-failover-cluster-to-windows-admin-center) or [Windows Admin Center](/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/use/manage-virtual-machines#live-migrate-a-virtual-machine-to-another-cluster-node). Live migration of VM storage is not supported.

    - question: |
        Is there a fee to manage Azure Local VMs?
      answer: |
        No. Azure Local VMs can be managed by Azure CLI or Azure portal. In either case, no fee is charged. Some VM extensions might have a fee. 

    - question: |
        Why are my image dropdown lists blank when creating my Azure Local VM using Trusted launch?
      answer: | 
        When you create an Azure Local VM using Trusted launch, your image must be available on your cluster. If your image isn't available, the dropdown lists during the creation process will be blank. This is by design. For information on which images work for Trusted launch VMs, see [Guest operating system images](./trusted-launch-vm-overview.md#guest-operating-system-images).

    - question: |
        Can I use the same name for gallery image projections and do existing VMs use the new image?
      answer: |
        Two images with the same name result in errors at the time of creating them, which is true for other resources as well, like logical networks, virtual hard disks etc. An updated image doesn't change existing VMs that use it. A copy of the VM image is created at the time VM creation.

    - question: | 
        How can I delete a VM image?  
      answer: |
        VM images and all other entities can be removed from CLI or from the Azure portal. For more information, see [Delete a VM image](./virtual-machine-image-azure-marketplace.md#delete-vm-image).   

    - question: |
        If I delete a gallery image would all the VMs also get deleted which are deployed?
      answer: |
        Deleting a gallery image doesn't affect the VMs that were created using that gallery image. The VMs won't be able to show the image name in the VM details.

    - question: | 
        If I delete Azure Arc resource bridge, are the VMs also deleted?
      answer: |
        If you inadvertently remove the Azure Arc resource bridge via the Azure portal, it results in the deletion of the Azure projection of the on-premises appliance VM. Importantly, this action doesn't impact your existing workloads. To restore the Azure projection of the Azure Arc resource bridge, run `az arcappliance create`. For more information, see [az arcappliance create hci](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/arcappliance/create?view=azure-cli-latest#az-arcappliance-create-hci). If the appliance on-premises VM is accidentally deleted, you lose the ability to manage your VMs through Azure portal, your workloads remain accessible through local on-premises tools like Windows Admin Center, Hyper-V, and PowerShell. To reinstate the Azure Arc resource bridge, a redeployment is required. For assistance with this process, contact Microsoft support.
