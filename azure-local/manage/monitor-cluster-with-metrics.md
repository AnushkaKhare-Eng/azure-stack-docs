# Monitor Azure Local with Azure Monitor Metrics

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes how to monitor your Azure Local system with [Azure Monitor Metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics). It also describes the Performance Metrics dashboard and lists metrics collected for compute, storage, and network resources in Azure Local.

When you have critical applications and business processes that rely on Azure resources, it's important to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. The integration of Azure Monitor Metrics with Azure Local enables you to store numeric data from your clusters in a dedicated time-series database. This database is automatically created for each Azure subscription. Use [metrics explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/tutorial-metrics) to analyze data from your Azure Local system and assess its health and utilization.

Take a few moments to watch the video walkthrough on creating metric charts in metrics explorer and alerts using Metrics:
