# Disaster recovery workloads for Azure Local

SQL Server  
Azure Local VMs can host highly performant SQL Server deployments, including those leveraging Always-On Availability Groups for enhanced resilience.  
The primary objective of SQL Server DR is to meet the application's specific Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) in the event of a disruption. SQL Server provides a rich set of built-in features for both high availability (HA) within a single site/cluster and disaster recovery to a secondary site/cluster.  
For SQL Server workloads running on Azure Local VMs, a comprehensive DR strategy must combine host-level protection mechanisms with SQL Server's own native HA/DR features. While host-level protection safeguards the entire server instance, including the operating system and SQL Server binaries, SQL-native solutions like Always-On Availability Groups and Log Shipping offer more granular control over database availability, provide application-consistent data protection, and can often achieve lower RPOs, especially for highly transactional databases 
By leveraging SQL Server’s own disaster recovery capabilities, in addition to Azure Local’s host-level protections, organizations can achieve more robust data protection and faster recovery times.  
This section outlines the key SQL Server disaster recovery features supported on Azure Local, and how Azure Arc integration further enhances these capabilities. 
Disaster Recovery Capabilities of SQL Server on Azure Local VMs 
SQL Server provides a range of proven disaster recovery technologies, all of which are fully supported on Azure Local deployments. You can choose one or combine several, depending on application requirements and your Recovery Point Objective (RPO) / Recovery Time Objective (RTO) targets. Below are the key SQL Server disaster recovery features and best-practice recommendations for using them on Azure Local: 
•	Always On Availability Groups (AG): 
A premier high-availability/disaster-recovery feature that protects a set of user databases by replicating transactions from a primary to one or more secondary replicas. In an Azure Local environment, Availability Groups can be used within a single cluster for high availability and across clusters or sites for disaster recovery. For automatic failover, deploy AGs on a Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) and use synchronous-commit mode between replicas in proximity (low latency network). Use asynchronous-commit mode for replicas at distant replicas (higher latency) to maximize performance. Distributed Availability Groups can also span multiple clusters for advanced scenarios. Always On AGs on Azure Local support both automatic and manual failover when configured appropriately and are the recommended solution for protecting critical databases requiring minimal downtime. For more information refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/overview-of-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver17  
•	Always On Failover Cluster Instances (FCI): 
An FCI is an instance-level high availability solution based on WSFC that provides failover of the entire SQL Server instance (including all databases) to another node in the cluster. An FCI on Azure Local uses the cluster’s shared storage (provided by the Azure Local S2D volumes) to ensure the SQL instance can restart on a second node with the same data. Best practice: Use FCIs to protect applications that require instance-level failover or in scenarios where shared storage is available. For more information refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/failover-clusters/windows/always-on-failover-cluster-instances-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16   
•	Log Shipping: 
Log shipping periodically backs up transaction logs from a primary database and restores them to a secondary database. This establishes a warm standby server that can be brought online in a disaster. On Azure Local, log shipping is fully supported and can be a simple, low-cost DR option for less time-sensitive databases. Best practice: Ensure the log backup frequency aligns with your RPO. Also monitor the restore delay on the secondary to estimate failover time. For more information refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/log-shipping/about-log-shipping-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver17  
•	Database Mirroring: 
Mirroring maintains two copies of a database and can be configured synchronously or asynchronously. However, mirroring is deprecated in recent SQL versions and is not recommended for new deployments. Instead, use Basic Availability Groups or full Always On AGs which provide similar capabilities on Azure Local without the limitations of mirroring. For more information refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/database-mirroring/database-mirroring-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver17  
•	Backup and Restore: 
Regular database backups including full, differential, and transaction log backups are the foundation of any disaster recovery strategy. SQL Server supports backing up to a disk or to a URL such as Azure Blob Storage. Customers can use Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS) or third-party tools to back up their whole VMs or applications to local disks and to cloud storage. SQL Server also offers Managed Backup to Azure, which can automatically schedule backups to cloud storage without MABS or any third party backup solution. Best practice: Use whichever tool makes sense for your environment, take frequent backups to meet your RPO goals and routinely test restoration. For more information refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/back-up-and-restore-of-sql-server-databases?view=sql-server-ver17  
•	Replication: 
SQL Server replication (Transactional, Merge, or Snapshot) allows copying and distributing data from one database to others in near real-time. While typically used for distributing read-only copies or synchronizing data, replication can also serve as part of a DR strategy. On Azure Local, all forms of SQL Server replication are supported. Caveat: Replication does not automatically fail over entire databases and may require manual reconfiguration in a disaster. For more information refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/replication/sql-server-replication?view=sql-server-ver17  

Choosing the right combination: 
All the above capabilities can be mixed to achieve a desired outcome. For example, use an Always on AG for zero-data-loss high availability within your primary site, and simultaneously use asynchronous replication to a secondary Azure Local instance off-site for disaster recovery. The choice should be guided by your application’s RPO/RTO requirements and whether the solution provides automatic failover or requires a manual process. 
Benefits of Arc-enabled SQL Server  
Every guest enabled Azure Local VM is Arc enabled, therefore the SQL Server inside the VM will automatically be Arc-enabled SQL Server. Through Azure Arc integration, you gain cloud-based visibility and management for your on-premises SQL Server’s disaster recovery setup. Azure Arc does not replace the SQL-native disaster recovery features above, but it provides unified tools to monitor, manage, and enhance these capabilities from the Azure portal.

Key Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server features for disaster recovery include: 
•	Always On Availability Group Management: 
View and manage Always-On AGs on Arc-enabled SQL Servers in the Azure portal. This includes seeing the list of availability groups, their replicas and synchronization state, and performing manual failover if needed. For more information refer to http://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/azure-arc/manage-availability-group?view=sql-server-ver17  
•	Failover Cluster Instance Visibility: 
Azure Arc surfaces SQL Server FCIs in the portal, allowing you to identify and monitor FCI deployments across your hybrid environment. For more information refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/azure-arc/support-for-fci?view=sql-server-ver17  
•	Automated Backup and Restore: 
Configure automated backups via Azure Policy or the portal. The Arc SQL Server extension can schedule and execute backups according to a defined policy. You can restore them from the portal as well. For more information refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/azure-arc/backup-local?view=sql-server-ver17&tabs=azure and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/azure-arc/point-in-time-restore?view=sql-server-ver17&tabs=azure  
•	Backup to URL with Managed Identity: 
Arc allows your on-prem SQL Server to use an Azure Managed Identity for authentication when backing up to Azure Blob Storage. This eliminates the need for SAS tokens or account keys. For more information refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/azure-arc/backup-to-url?view=sql-server-ver17  
 
Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)  
Azure Virtual Desktop provides a comprehensive platform for securely delivering virtualized Windows desktops and applications to users anywhere, seamlessly integrating with both cloud and on-premises environments.  
The AVD architecture consists of several core components, including session host virtual machines, the AVD control plane (which manages user connections, brokering, and gateway services form the cloud), user profile storage (such as FSLogix), and network configurations that together provide a seamless virtual desktop experience. An effective DR strategy for AVD on Azure Local must account for the recovery and continuity of each of these components to ensure a smooth transition upon failover. 

AVD session hosts are virtual machines that run the actual desktop and application environments users connect to when accessing Azure Virtual Desktop; each session host delivers resources, manages user sessions, and ensures workloads are isolated and performant. As a result, many of the VM recovery options listed for Azure Local VMs also apply to AVD, but require additional considerations to account for the other core components of a virtual desktop solution.  

Pooled Host Pools 
In the pooled model, users are assigned to any available session host from a pool, and the VMs are ideally stateless. User-specific data and settings are roamed using FSLogix profile containers, which store the entire user profile in a VHD(X) file dynamically attached at sign-in. For DR, the primary focus for pooled hosts is on ensuring the availability of the golden image used to deploy session hosts, the FSLogix profile containers, and any MSIX app attach packages to rebuild the image. Since the VMs are not mapped directly to a user, full VM backup and failover methods like ASR and Hyper-V Replica may not be needed.  

The recommended DR approach for pooled session hosts is to create a host pool on a secondary site, either Azure or another cluster, and configure it to match the primary host pool. These hosts can remain dormant and be turned on at failover time or can be always active. It is important to ensure that the secondary host pool has access to the same FSLogix profiles and are built from the same image at the primary hosts to provide the same experience to users. You can use OneDrive redirection to ensure FSLogix profiles stay in sync between the two sites.  
At failover time, if the hosts are dormant, they must be turned on and users reassigned to the secondary host pool. If they are always active, no admin intervention is needed at failover time. Failing back after the primary cluster’s health is restored is done similarly by reassigning users if needed.  

Personal Host Pools
With personal session hosts, each user is assigned to a specific, dedicated session host VM. These VMs are stateful, as users may install applications or store data directly on them. Consequently, DR for personal session hosts typically requires full VM-level backup and replication (e.g., using Hyper-V Replica or ASR) to preserve the unique state of each user's desktop.
