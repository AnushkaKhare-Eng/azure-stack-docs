1. Connect to your Azure Local machine.

1. Run the following PowerShell command using local administrator credentials or deployment user (AzureStackLCMUser) credentials.

1. Run the following cmdlet to check the Application Control policy mode that is currently enabled:

   ```powershell
   Get-AsWdacPolicyMode
   ```
   This cmdlet returns Audit or Enforced Mode per Node.
	
1. Run the following cmdlet to switch the policy mode:

   ```powershell
   Enable-AsWdacPolicy -Mode <PolicyMode [Audit | Enforced]>
   ```
   
   For example, to switch the policy mode to audit, run:

   ```powershell
   Enable-AsWdacPolicy -Mode Audit
   ```

   > [!WARNING]
   > The Orchestrator will take up to two to three minutes to switch to the selected mode.

1. Run `Get-ASWDACPolicyMode` again to confirm the policy mode is updated.

   ```powershell
   Get-AsWdacPolicyMode
   ```

   Here's a sample output of these cmdlets:

   ```azurepowershell
