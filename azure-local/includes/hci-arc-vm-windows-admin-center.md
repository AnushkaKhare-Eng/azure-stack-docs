> [!NOTE]
> The recommended way to create and manage VMs on Azure Local is using the [Azure Local VM management](../manage/azure-arc-vm-management-overview.md). However, since the functionality described in this article isn't yet provided by Azure Local VM management, you can use Windows Admin Center or PowerShell as described below. Note that VMs created this way aren't enabled by Azure Arc, have limited manageability from the Azure Arc control plane, and fewer Azure Hybrid Benefits, including usage of Azure Update Manager at no extra cost. For more information, see [Compare management capabilities of VMs on Azure Local](../concepts/compare-vm-management-capabilities.md) and [Supported operations for Azure Local VMs](../manage/virtual-machine-operations.md).
