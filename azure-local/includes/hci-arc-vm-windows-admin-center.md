> [!NOTE]
> The recommended way to create and manage VMs on Azure Local is using [Azure Local VM management](../manage/azure-arc-vm-management-overview.md). However, since the functionality described in this article isn't yet provided by Azure Local VM management, you can use Windows Admin Center or PowerShell as described below. Note however that Azure Local VMs created this way aren't enabled by Azure Arc. They have limited manageability from the Azure Local VM management plane and fewer Azure Hybrid Benefits, such as no free use of Azure Update Manager.
