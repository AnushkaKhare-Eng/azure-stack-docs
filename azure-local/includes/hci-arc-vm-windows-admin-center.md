> [!NOTE]
> The recommended way to create and manage VMs on Azure Local is using the [What is Azure Local VM management?](../manage/azure-arc-vm-management-overview.md). However, since the functionality described in this article is not yet provided by Azure Local, you can use Windows Admin Center or PowerShell as described below. Note that VMs created this way aren't Arc-enabled VMs. They have limited manageability from the Azure Arc control plane and fewer Azure Hybrid Benefits, such as no free use of Azure Update Manager.
