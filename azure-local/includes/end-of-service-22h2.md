> Azure Local, version 22H2 will reach end of service by May 2025. After that, you won't receive monthly security and quality updates that provide protection from the latest security threats. To continue receiving updates, we recommend updating your operating system to [version 23H2](../upgrade/upgrade-22h2-to-23h2-powershell.md).
>
> If you're currently running an Azure Local, version 22H2 stretch cluster or managing Azure Local via System Center - Virtual Machine Manager, review the [Supported workloads and configurations](../upgrade/about-upgrades-23h2.md#supported-workloads-and-configurations) table for update timelines.
