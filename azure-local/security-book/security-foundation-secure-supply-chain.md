The work to secure the supply chain for software is important to Microsoft and the world. The changing landscape and speed of technology has warranted efforts by Governments, organizations, and corporations alike to improve oversight and build in new capabilities. Microsoft is actively involved in developing standards (such as IETF and OpenSSF) and working with others to produce innovative changes. The initial focus is on how we and others produce products but with an eye towards running systems. 
 
Work started with the development of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from which the third-party dependencies (ingredients) must be listed. This includes binding of evidence claims and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) reports. The latter will enable a broader ability to assess risk and issues in dependent products.
