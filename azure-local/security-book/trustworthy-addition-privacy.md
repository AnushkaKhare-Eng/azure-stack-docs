Azure Local collects the minimum data required to keep the system current, secure, and operating properly. This includes telemetry event data and diagnostics data. Telemetry pipeline transmits a steady stream of curated events to Azure. The diagnostics pipeline emits an episodic set of diagnostic data to Azure only when allowed by the customer. Data collection is enabled by default in Azure Local. However, you can disable data collection by changing the service health data setting via the Azure portal. For more information, see [Azure Local data collection](/previous-versions/azure/azure-local/concepts/data-collection).
