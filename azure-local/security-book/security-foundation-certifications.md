Microsoft is committed to supporting product security standards and certifications, including FIPS 140 and Common Criteria as an external validation of security assurance. The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140 is a U.S. government standard that defines minimum security requirements for cryptographic modules in IT products. Microsoft maintains an active commitment to meeting the requirements of the FIPS 140 standard, having validated cryptographic modules in Windows operating systems against FIPS 140-2 since it was first established in 2001.
 
Common Criteria (CC) is an international standard currently maintained by national governments who participate in the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement. CC defines a common taxonomy for security functional requirements, security assurance requirements, and an evaluation methodology used to ensure products undergoing evaluation satisfy the functional and assurance requirements. Microsoft ensures that products incorporate the features and functions required by relevant Common Criteria Protection Profiles and completes Common Criteria certifications of Microsoft Windows products.
 
Microsoft publishes the list of FIPS 140 and CC certified products at [Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 Validation and Common Criteria Certifications](/windows/security/security-foundations/certification/fips-140-validation).
