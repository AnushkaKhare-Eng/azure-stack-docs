Microsoft Defender Antivirus is real-time, behavior-based, and heuristic antivirus protection. It helps protect the operating system against viruses, malware, spyware, and other threats. In addition to real-time protection, updates are downloaded automatically to help keep your device safe and protect it from threats.

The combination of always-on content scanning, file and process behavior monitoring, and other heuristics effectively prevents security threats. Microsoft Defender Antivirus continually scans for malware and threats, and it detects and blocks potentially unwanted applications (PUA) which are applications that are deemed to negatively impact your device but are not considered malware. Microsoft Defender Antivirus always-on protection is integrated with cloud-delivered protection, which helps ensure near instant detection and blocking of new and emerging threats. To learn more, seeâ€¯Microsoft Defender Antivirus. By default, [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server) is enabled in Azure Local.
