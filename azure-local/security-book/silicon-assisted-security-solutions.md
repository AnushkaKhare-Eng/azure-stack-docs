Secured-core machines can be easily identified in the [Azure Local catalog](https://azurelocalsolutions.azure.microsoft.com/#/catalog) as well as in the [Windows Server catalog](https://www.windowsservercatalog.com/). Azure Local solutions supporting Secured-core capabilities are available from industry leading solution builders today. Furthermore, starting with Azure Local, version 22H2, Secured-core support is required on all new solutions based on Gen 3 or newer CPU. Thus, customers will benefit from host protection that is available with Microsoft OS platforms.

Microsoft Hardware Solution Partners provide [Azure Local solution categories](https://azurelocalsolutions.azure.microsoft.com/#/Learn) (Premier Solutions, Integrated Systems and Validated Nodes) with hardware service, support, and security updates for at least five years.
