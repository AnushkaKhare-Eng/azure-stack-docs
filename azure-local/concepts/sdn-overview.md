# Software Defined Networking enabled by Azure Arc on Azure Local (Preview)

> Applies to: Azure Local 2504 and later

This article provides an overview of the Software defined networking (SDN) enabled by Azure Arc on Azure Local including the types of SDN, when to use which type, and supported scenarios for SDN.

SDN provides a way to centrally configure and manage networks and network services such as switching, routing, and load balancing in your datacenter. You can use SDN to dynamically create, secure, and connect your network to meet the evolving needs of your apps. <!--Operating global-scale datacenter networks for services like Microsoft Azure, which efficiently performs tens of thousands of network changes every day, is possible only because of SDN.-->

## About SDN enabled by Arc on Azure Local

The Azure Local solution has the following two types of SDN:

- **SDN enabled by Arc**: This is the Preview SDN solution that is available in Azure Local 2504 and later. This preview solution isn't recommended for production use.

    This SDN has Network Controller running as a Failover Cluster service. There's no need to deploy extra VMs to run the Network Controller thus allowing more capacity for workloads.

    Once you enable SDN, you can manage logical networks, network security groups, and virtual machine networks interfaces via the Arc control plane.

    With SDN enabled by Arc:

    - The existing and new logical networks are managed by the network controller.
    - You can create and apply network security groups to logical networks and virtual machine network interfaces (NICs). You can also create and add security rules.
    - You can create and delete virtual machine NICs.

- **SDN managed by on-prem tools**: This SDN solution is available for Windows Server and for Azure Local 2311.2 and later. This SDN has three major components, and you can choose which you want to deploy: Network Controller, Software Load Balancer, and Gateway. For more information, see [SDN managed by on-prem tools](../concepts/software-defined-networking-23h2.md).


## Supported operations for SDN enabled by Arc and SDN managed by on-prem tools

Here is a summary of the supported operations for SDN enabled by Arc and SDN managed by on-prem tools:

| SDN type | SDN resources  | VM types  | Management tools  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| SDN enabled by Arc   | Logical networks<br>VM NICs<br>Network security groups        | Azure Local VMs        | Azure portal <br> Azure CLI <br> ARM templates         |
| SDN managed by on-prem tools     |Logical networks<br>VM NICs<br>Network security groups<br>Virtual networks<br>Peering<br>Software Load Balancers<br>VPN Gateways        | Hyper-V VMs<br>SCVMM VMs         | SDN Express<br>Windows Admin Center<br>PowerShell<br>SCVMM VMs        |

For SDN enabled by Arc, the following resources aren't supported:

- Virtual networks
- Virtual network peering
- Software Load Balancers (SLBs)
- VPN Gateways


## Supported networking patterns for SDN enabled by Arc

Before enabling SDN, we recommend you check the following supported networking patterns and available options.

### Group all traffic on single network intent

Insert a network diagram here.

- Use this pattern only with switched storage network connectivity.
- Use the *Group all traffic* host networking pattern in single or multi node configuration.
- A single virtual switch is available to create SDN resources.
- The Azure Virtual Filtering extensions are turned on after the Network Controller is enabled.  

### Group management and compute traffic

Insert a network diagram here.

- Use this pattern with switched or switchless storage network connectivity for up to 4-node Azure Local deployments. Use only storage switched connectivity for deployments with 5 or more nodes.
- Use the *Group management and compute traffic* host networking pattern in single or multi node configuration.
- A single virtual switch is available to create SDN resources.
- The Azure Virtual Filtering extensions are turned on after the Network Controller is enabled.  

### Custom configuration - Disaggregated host networking

Insert a network diagram here.

- Use this pattern with switched or switchless storage connectivity for up to 4-node Azure Local deployments. Use only storage switched connectivity for deployments with 5 or more nodes.
- Use the *Custom configuration* host networking pattern in single or multi node configuration.
- A single virtual switch is available to create SDN resources.
- You can use up to 3 network intents provided there are enough network adapter ports to disaggregate the network traffic types.
    - The first management intent is used only for host management traffic.
    - The second compute intent is used only for VMs and workloads traffic.
    - The third storage intent is used only for storage traffic.

## Choose SDN type based on your requirements

Starting release 2504, you have two ways to enable SDN.

- Use SDN enabled by Arc if workloads only require logical networks based on VLAN isolation and network security groups to secure access.â€‹
- Use SDN managed by on-prem tools if workloads require virtual networks for isolation, and load balancers or gateways.

Use the following detailed decision matrix to select the SDN type based on your requirements:
