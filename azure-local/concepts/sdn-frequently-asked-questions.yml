title: FAQ - SDN enabled by Azure Arc on Azure Local
summary: Ths Azure Local FAQ provides information about Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enabled by Azure Arc on your Azure Local VMs.

  - name: Azure Local connectivity and general FAQ
    questions:
      - question: Will I have downtime for my Azure Local VMs when I enable Network Controller via the Action Plan?
        answer: |
          Yes. The action plan configures all the Azure Local VMs with a null port profile to enable network connectivity. As this configuration is performed for all the VMs, you experience a brief downtime  until all the VMs in the cluster are configured.  
  
          As this is a disruptive operation, make sure to plan for a maintenance window if you're running on a production environment.

      - question: Why am I experiencing network connectivity issues for my unmanaged VMs on Azure Local after I enabled SDN enabled by Azure Arc?
        answer: |
          You might encounter network connectivity issues after you enable the Network Controller and create unmanaged VMs outside of Azure interfaces such as Azure Command-line Interface, Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, and Azure Resource Manager APIs. For more information, see how to [Unblock and configure null port profile for your unmanaged VMs]() to fix network connectivity issues.

      - question: Why can't I connect to my Azure Local VMs, if I associate an NSG with the VM network interface or its logical network?
        answer: |
          If you configure an empty NSG, one with no security rules, on your VM’s network interface or the logical network the VM is on – by default, no inbound traffic is allowed into the VM and all the outbound traffic is allowed. You need to add specific inbound network security rules to allow inbound traffic into the VM.
          
      - question: Can I modify Azure Local VM resources such as VMs, virtual switches, and network interfaces directly using Network Controller APIs, Windows Admin Center, or SDN Express PowerShell scripts for my Azure Local VMs?  
        answer: |
          No. This shouldn't be done and is an unsupported scenario. Doing so can cause your resources to go into bad or unrecoverable states.

      - question: Can I configure static network interfaces after the Azure Local VM is provisioned on an Azure Local instance with SDN enabled by Azure Arc?
        answer: |
          No. Adding a secondary network interface to a VM after the VM is provisioned, is currently not supported. Such configurations cause both network interfaces to be assigned as the default gateway and lead to asymmetric networking symptoms like packet-loss and cause the VMs networking to be unpredictable. You must configure all the static network interfaces you need at the time of VM provisioning when using SDN enabled by Azure Arc.
      - question: Why am I seeing unexpected traffic drop or blocks for my Azure Local VMs?
        answer: |
          If logical networks and VM network interfaces on your Azure Local VMs have NSGs applied with conflicting allow/deny rules, this could lead to unexpected traffic drops or blocks. <br><br> When an inbound packet arrives, Azure Local first evaluates the logical network NSG, and then the network NSG. For outbound traffic, Azure Local evaluates the network interface NSG first and then the logical network NSG. If the first NSG encountered has a **Deny** on the logical network and an **Allow** appears on the network interface, the packet is dropped.
