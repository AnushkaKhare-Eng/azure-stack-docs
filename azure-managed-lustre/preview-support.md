# Public preview support information for Azure Managed Lustre (Preview)

<!--STATUS: Ported as is from private preview. Only updated title. Support must be updated for public preview. Dillip owns updates.-->

During the private preview period for Azure Managed Lustre, the following support standards apply.

* Support for the service will be best effort during regular business hours (US Eastern Time) for the private preview period.

* Customers can ask questions and report problems by emailing the team at amlfs@microsoft.com ("amlfs" is an informal abbreviation for Azure Managed Lustre file system). This email alias is monitored by Azure Managed Lustre PM, Service Engineering, and Development teams.

* In the event of a perceived performance problem, the Azure Managed Lustre Service Engineering, PM, and/or Development team will engage with the customer via email and Teams screen-sharing meeting if necessary.

* User documentation resides in an access-controlled GitHub repository. A GitHub account is required to access the documentation. To request access to the documentation, please send an email to amlfs@microsoft.com and include a valid GitHub username.

* Upgrades and patches (for bugs, features, and security vulnerabilities) will be performed by the Azure Managed Lustre Engineering team. In many cases, during the private preview period, this work may require that the cluster be destroyed and recreated. This destructive update can be done without notice for a severe issue. In general, the team will do their best to notify users of the upgrade in advance.

* Any remaining Azure Managed Lustre deployments will be destroyed at the end of the private preview period.
