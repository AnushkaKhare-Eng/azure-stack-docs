# Create an Azure Managed Lustre file system

If you'd prefer to use Azure Resource Manager templates to create your file system, see [Create a file system using Azure Resource Manager templates](create-file-system-resource-manager.md).

This article describes how to create an Azure Managed Lustre file system in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

Plan the following configuration options carefully, as they can't be changed after you create your file system:

- Size of the file system, in terms of storage capacity and throughput.
- Encryption key management, whether Microsoft-managed keys or customer-managed keys.

## Sign in to the Azure portal

1. Sign in to [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Type **Azure Managed Lustre** in the search box, and press **Enter**.

1. On the **Azure Managed Lustre** page, select **+ Create**.

## Basics

On the **Basics** tab, enter the following information:

### Project details

1. Select the subscription to use for Azure Managed Lustre.

1. In **Resource group**, select a resource group, or create a new one to use for this installation.

1. **Region** and **Availability zone**: Select the Azure region and availability zone (if the region supports zones) for your file system.

   For best performance, create your Azure Managed Lustre file system in the same region and availability zone as your client machines.

### File system details

Set the name and capacity of the Azure Managed Lustre file system:

1. **File system name**: Choose a name to identify this file system in your list of resources.

2. **File system type**: Shows **Durable, SSD**, the type of infrastructure that's available for the file system.

3. **Storage and throughput**: Use these settings to set the size of your file system.

   There are two factors that determine your file system size: the amount of storage allocated for your data (storage capacity), and the maximum data transfer rate (throughput). When you select one of these options, the other values are calculated based on the  **Throughput per TiB** setting for your file system type.

  To set your Azure Managed Lustre file system size, do these steps:
  
1. Choose either **Storage capacity** or **Maximum throughput**.

   1. Enter a value in the field, either your desired storage capacity (in TiB) if you selected **Storage capacity**, or your desired maximum throughput (in MB/second) if you selected **Maximum throughput**.

     > [!NOTE]
     > These values are rounded up to meet incremental size requirements. They are never rounded down, so make sure you check the final configuration to make sure it's cost-effective for your workload.

     ![Screenshot showing Storage and Throughput settings to size an Azure Managed Lustre file system during file system creation.](./media/create-file-system-portal/basics-file-system-details.png)

Currently, the following throughput configurations are available:

| Throughput per TiB storage | Storage Min| Storage Max| Increment|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 40 MB/second | 48 TB | 768 TB | 48 TB|
| 125 MB/second | 16 TB | 128 TB | 16 TB |
| 250 MB/second | 8 TB | 128 TB | 8 TB |
| 500 MB/second | 4 TB | 128 TB | 4 TB |

> [!NOTE]
> Upon request, Azure Managed Lustre can support larger storage capacities up to 2.5PB. To make a request for a larger storage capacity, please [open a support ticket](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/~/overview).
>
> If you need cluster sizes greater than 2.5PB, you can [open a support ticket](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/~/overview) to discuss additional options.

### Networking

In the **Networking** section:

1. Enter the virtual network and subnet that you configured earlier in [Network prerequisites](amlfs-prerequisites.md#network-prerequisites).

1. **Virtual network**: Select or create the network for your Azure Managed Lustre file system.

   1. **Subnet**: Select or create the subnet to use for file system interaction.

   The Azure Managed Lustre file system uses a dedicated virtual network and one subnet. The subnet contains the Lustre Management Service (MGS), which handles all of the client interaction with the Azure Managed Lustre system.

   You can open the **Manage subnet configuration** link to make sure the subnet meets your network requirements. The network should have enough available IP addresses to handle the file system's load and any additional IP addresses required by any other services that are co-located with the file system.

   Make sure you complete all access settings to enable the subnet to access the needed Azure services.

   For more information about network sizing and other configuration options, see [Network prerequisites](amlfs-prerequisites.md#network-prerequisites).

   ![Screenshot showing Network settings for an Azure Managed Lustre file system.](./media/create-file-system-portal/basics-networking.png)

When you finish entering the **Basic** settings, select **Next: Advanced** to continue.

> [!NOTE]
> Moving an Azure Virtual Network Manager instance is not currently supported. The existing virtual network manager instance might be deleted and another created in a new location using the Azure Resource Manager template.

## Advanced

Use the **Advanced** tab to optionally set up Blob Storage integration and customize the maintenance window.

### Blob integration

If you want to integrate data from Azure Blob Storage with your Azure Managed Lustre file system, you can specify the details in the **Blob integration** section when you create the file system. This integration allows you to import and export data between the file system and a blob container.

Configuring blob integration during cluster creation is optional, but it's the only way to use [Lustre Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM)](https://doc.lustre.org/lustre_manual.xhtml#lustrehsm) features. If you don't want the benefits of Lustre HSM, you can import and export data for the Azure Managed Lustre file system by using client commands directly.

To configure blob integration, follow these steps:

1. Create or configure a storage account and blob containers for integration with the file system. To learn more about the requirements for these resources, see [Blob integration prerequisites](amlfs-prerequisites.md#blob-integration-prerequisites-optional). The storage account doesn't need to be in the same subscription as the Azure Managed Lustre file system.
1. Select the **Import/export data from blob** check box.
1. Specify the **Subscription**, **Storage account**, and **Container** to use with your Lustre file system.
1. In the **Logging container** field, select the container where you want to store import/export logs. The logs must be stored in a separate container from the data container, but the containers must be in the same storage account.
1. In the **Import prefix** fields, you can optionally supply one or more prefixes to filter the data imported into the Azure Managed Lustre file system. The default import prefix is `/`, and the default behavior imports the contents of the entire blob container. To learn more about import prefixes, see [Import prefix](blob-integration.md#import-prefix).

### Maintenance window

To allow Azure staff to maintain your Azure Managed Lustre file system, they need access to the file system to run diagnostics, update software, and troubleshoot any problems. Use the **Maintenance window** setting to set a time when the system can be disrupted for routine service.

Tasks that are active during this service might fail, or might only be delayed. Testing is ongoing to determine this behavior.

After the general availability (GA) release, maintenance is performed less than once a month. Routine software upgrades happen about six times a year, and approximately five other update tasks might be needed to address vulnerabilities or critical bugs over the same time.

When you finish entering **Advanced settings**:

* If you want to use your own encryption keys for your Azure Managed Lustre file system storage, select **Next: Disk encryption keys**.
* If you don't want to use your own encryption keys, select **Review + create**. You're ready to create your file system.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change between Microsoft-managed keys and customer-managed keys after your create the file system.

## Disk encryption keys (optional)

If you want to manage the encryption keys used for your Azure Managed Lustre file system storage, supply your Azure Key Vault information on the **Disk encryption keys** page. The key vault must be in the same region and in the same subscription as the cache.

You can skip this section if you don't need customer-managed keys. Azure encrypts data with Microsoft-managed keys by default. For more information, see [Azure storage encryption](/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption).

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change between Microsoft-managed keys and customer-managed keys after creating the file system.

For a complete explanation of the customer-managed key encryption process, see [Use customer-managed encryption keys with Azure Managed Lustre](customer-managed-encryption-keys.md).

To use customer-managed encryption keys with your Azure Managed Lustre file system, follow these steps:

1. For **Disk encryption key type**, select **Customer managed**.

   The key vault specification fields appear.

1. Under **Customer key settings**, open the **Select or create a key vault, key, or version** link.

   ![Screenshot showing Customer Key Settings for the Create command for Azure Managed Lustre.](./media/create-file-system-portal/customer-key-settings.png)

1. On the **Select a key** screen, select the **Key vault**, **key**, and **Version** of the key to use for this file system. Then choose **Select**.

   You can create a new key vault, key, and key version from this page. The key must be a 2048-bit RSA key, and must be stored in Azure Key Vault.

   ![Screenshot showing Select a key screen while creating Azure Managed Lustre file system.](./media/create-file-system-portal/key-vault-key-version.png)

      **Customer key settings** now displays your key vault, key, and version.

   ![Screenshot showing sample Customer key settings on Basics tab for an Azure Managed Lustre file system.](./media/create-file-system-portal/keys-summary.png)

1. In **Managed identities**, specify one or more user-assigned managed identities to use for this file system. Each identity must have access to the key vault in order to successfully create the Azure Managed Lustre file system.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You cannot change the assigned identity after you create the file system.

   To learn more, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

When you finish entering customer key settings and managed identities, select **Review + create** to continue.

## Review settings and create the file system

On the **Review + create** tab, when a **Validation passed** message appears, select **Create** to begin creating the file system.

Your Azure Managed Lustre file system should appear in your portal **Resources** page within 30 minutes.
