# Create server and site affinity rules for VMs

> Applies to Azure Stack HCI version 20H2

Using Windows PowerShell, you can easily create affinity and anti-affinity rules for your virtual machines (VMs) in a cluster.

Affinity is a rule that establishes a relationship between two or more resource groups or roles, such as virtual machines (VMs), to keep them together in an Azure Stack HCI cluster. Anti-affinity is the opposite in that it is used to keep the specified resource groups apart from each other.

Affinity and anti-affinity rules are used similarly to the way Azure uses Availability Zones. In Azure, you can configure Availability Zones to keep VMs in separate zones and away from each other or in the same zone with each other.  

Using affinity and anti-affinity rules, any clustered VM would either stay in the same cluster node or be prevented from being together in the same cluster node.  In this way, the only way to move a VM out of a node would be to do it manually.  You can also keep VMs together with the Cluster Shared Volume (CSV) that its VHDX resides on.

Combining affinity and anti-affinity rules, you can also configure a stretched cluster across two sites (fault domains) and keep your VMs in the site they need to be in.

Typically, you set up your rules from a remote computer, rather than on a host server in a cluster. This remote computer is called the management computer.

> [!NOTE]
> When running PowerShell commands from a management computer, include the -Name or -Cluster parameter with the name of the cluster you are managing. If applicable, you will also need to specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) when using the -ComputerName parameter for a server node

## New PowerShell cmdlets

To create affinity rules for Azure Stack HCI clusters, use the following PowerShell cmdlets.

### New-ClusterAffinityRule

The **`New-ClusterAffinityRule`** cmdlet is used to create new rules.  With this command you would specify the name of the rule as well as the type of rule it is, where:

**`-Name`** is the name of the rule

**`-RuleType`**	values are `SameFaultDomain` | `SameNode` | `DifferentFaultDomain` | `DifferentNode`

Example:

```powershell
New-ClusterAffinityRule -Name -RuleType SameFaultDomain -Cluster Cluster1
```

### Set-ClusterAffinityRule

The **`Set-ClusterAffinityRule`** cmdlet is used to enable or disable a rule, where:

**`-Name`** is the name of the rule to enable or disable

**`-Enabled`** | **`Disabled`** enables or disables the rule

Example:

```powershell
Set-ClusterAffinityRule -Name -Enabled -Cluster Cluster1
```

### Get-ClusterAffinityRule

The **`Get-ClusterAffinityRule`** cmdlet is used to display the specified rule and what type it is.  If **`-Name`** is not specified, it will list all rules.

Example:

```powershell
Get-ClusterAffinityRule -Name -Cluster Cluster1
```

### Add-ClusterGroupToAffinityRule

The **`Add-ClusterGroupToAffinityRule`** cmdlet is used to add a VM role or group name to a specific affinity rule, where:

**`-Groups`** is the name of the group or role to add to the rule

**`-Name`** is the name of the rule to add to

Example:

```powershell
Add-ClusterGroupToAffinityRule -Groups -Name -Cluster Cluster1
```

### Add-ClusterSharedVolumeToAffinityRule

The **`Add-ClusterSharedVolumeToAffinityRule`** allows your VMs to stay together with the Cluster Shared Volume the VHDX resides on, where:

**`-ClusterSharedVolumes`** is the CSV disk(s) you wish to add to the rule

**`-Name`** is the name of rule to add to

Example:

```powershell
Add-ClusterSharedVolumeToAffinityRule  -ClusterSharedVolumes -Name -Cluster Cluster1
```

### Remove-ClusterAffinityRule

The **`Remove-ClusterAffinityRule`** deletes the specified rule, where **`-Name`** is the name of the rule.

Example:

```powershell
Remove-ClusterAffinityRule -Name -Cluster Cluster1
```

### Remove-ClusterGroupFromAffinityRule

The **`Remove-ClusterGroupFromAffinityRule`** removes a VM group or role from a specific rule but does not disable or delete the rule, where:

**`-Name`** is the name of the rule

**`-Groups`** are the groups or roles you wish to remove from the rule

Example:

```powershell
Remove-ClusterGroupFromAffinityRule -Name -Groups -Cluster Cluster1
```

### Remove-ClusterSharedVolumeFromAffinityRule

The **`Remove-ClusterSharedVolumeFromAffinityRule`** cmdlet is used to remove the Cluster Shared Volumes from a specific rule but does not disable or delete the rule, where:

**`-ClusterSharedVolumes`** is the CSV disk(s) you want to remove from the rule

**`-Name`** is the name of the rule to add to

Example:

```powershell
Remove-ClusterSharedVolumeFromAffinityRule -ClusterSharedVolumes -Name -Cluster Cluster1
```

## Existing PowerShell cmdlets

With the advent of the new cmdlets, we also added additional new switches to a few existing cmdlets.

### Move-ClusterGroup

The new `-IgnoreAffinityRule` switch ignores the rule and moves the clustered resource group to another cluster node. For more information on this cmdlet, see [Move-ClusterGroup](/powershell/module/failoverclusters/move-clustergroup?view=win10-ps).

Example:

```powershell
Move-ClusterGroup -IgnoreAffinityRule -Cluster Cluster1
```

> [!NOTE]
> If a move rule is valid (supported), all groups and roles that are affected will also move.  If a VM move will knowingly violate a rule yet it is needed on a one-time temporary basis, use the `-IgnoreAffinityRule` switch to allow the move to occur. In this case, a violation warning for the VM will be displayed. You can then enable the rule back as necessary.

### Start-ClusterGroup

The new `-IgnoreAffinityRule` switch ignores the rule and brings the clustered resource group online in its current location. For more information on this cmdlet, see [Start-ClusterGroup](/powershell/module/failoverclusters/start-clustergroup?view=win10-ps).

Example:

```powershell
Start-ClusterGroup -IgnoreAffinityRule -Cluster Cluster1
```

## Anti-affinity rules

### Scenario 1
You have two VMs each running SQL Server on the same Azure Stack HCI multi-site cluster.  Each VM utilizes a lot of memory, CPU, and storage resources.  If the two end up on the same node, this can cause performance issues with one or both as they compete for memory, CPU, and storage cycles.  Using an anti-affinity rule with `DifferentNode` as the rule type, these VMs will always stay on different cluster nodes.  

The example commands for this would be:

```powershell
New-ClusterAffinityRule -Name SQL -Ruletype DifferentNode -Cluster Cluster1

Add-ClusterGroupToAffinityRule -Groups SQL1,SQL2 –Name SQL -Cluster Cluster1

Set-ClusterAffinityRule -Name SQL -Enabled 1 -Cluster Cluster1
```

To see the rule and how it is configured, use the **`Get-ClusterAffinityRule`** cmdlet to see the output:

```powershell
Get-ClusterAffinityRule -Name SQL -Cluster Cluster1

Name    RuleType        Groups        Enabled
----    -----------     -------       -------
SQL     DifferentNode   {SQL1, SQL2}     1
```

### Scenario 2

Let's say you have an Azure Stack HCI stretched cluster with two sites (fault domains). You have two domain controllers you wish to keep in separate sites. Using an anti-affinity rule with `DifferentFaultDomain` as a rule type, these domain controllers will always stay in different sites.  The example commands for this would be:

```powershell
New-ClusterAffinityRule -Name DC -Ruletype DifferentFaultDomain -Cluster Cluster1

Add-ClusterGroupToAffinityRule -Groups DC1,DC2 –Name DC -Cluster Cluster1

Set-ClusterAffinityRule -Name DC -Enabled 1 -Cluster Cluster1
```

To see this rule and how it is configured, use the **`Get-ClusterAffinityRule`** cmdlet to see the output:

```powershell
Get-ClusterAffinityRule -Name DC -Cluster Cluster1

Name    RuleType                Groups        Enabled
----    --------                -------       -------
DC      DifferentFaultDomain    {DC1, DC2}       1
```

## Affinity rules

Here are a few common scenarios for setting up affinity rules.

### Scenario 1

Suppose you have a SQL Server VM and a Web Server VM. These two VMs need to always remain in the same site but do not necessarily need to be on the same cluster node in the site.  Using `SameFaultDomain`, this is possible, as shown below:

```powershell
New-ClusterAffinityRule -Name WebData -Ruletype SameFaultDomain -Cluster Cluster1

Add-ClusterGroupToAffinityRule -Groups SQL1,WEB1 –Name WebData -Cluster Cluster1

Set-ClusterAffinityRule -Name WebData -Enabled 1 -Cluster Cluster1
```

To see this rule and how it is configured, use the **`Get-ClusterAffinityRule`** cmdlet to see the output:

```powershell
Get-ClusterAffinityRule -Name WebData -Cluster Cluster1

Name        RuleType          Groups        Enabled
----        ---------         ------        -------
WebData     SameFaultDomain   {SQL1, WEB1}     1
```

### Scenario 2
Let's use the same scenario above except specify that the VMs must reside on the same cluster node but not necessarily in the same site. Using `SameNode`, you can set this as follows:

```powershell
New-ClusterAffinityRule -Name WebData1 -Ruletype SameNode -Cluster Cluster1

Add-ClusterGroupToAffinityRule -Groups SQL1,WEB1 –Name WebData1 -Cluster Cluster1

Set-ClusterAffinityRule -Name WebData1 -Enabled 1 -Cluster Cluster1
```

To see the rule and how it is configured, use the **`Get-ClusterAffinityRule`** cmdlet to see the output:

```powershell
Get-ClusterAffinityRule -Name WebData1 -Cluster Cluster1

Name    RuleType    Groups        Enabled
----    --------    ------        -------
DC      SameNode    {SQL1, WEB1}     1
```

## Combined rules

Combining affinity and anti-affinity rules, you can easily configure various VM combinations across a multi-site cluster.  In this scenario, each site has three VMs: SQL Server (SQL), Web Server (WEB), and domain controller (DC).  For each of the combinations, you can use affinity rules with `SameFaultDomain` to keep them all in the same site.  You can also set the domain controllers for each site with anti-affinity rules and `DifferentFaultDomain` to keep the domain controller VMs in separate sites as shown below:

```powershell
New-ClusterAffinityRule -Name Site1Trio -Ruletype SameFaultDomain -Cluster Cluster1

New-ClusterAffinityRule -Name Site2Trio -Ruletype SameFaultDomain -Cluster Cluster1

New-ClusterAffinityRule -Name TrioApart -Ruletype DifferentFaultDomain -Cluster Cluster1

Add-ClusterGroupToAffinityRule -Groups SQL1,WEB1,DC1 –Name Site1Trio -Cluster Cluster1

Add-ClusterGroupToAffinityRule -Groups SQL2,WEB2,DC2 –Name Site2Trio -Cluster Cluster1

Add-ClusterGroupToAffinityRule -Groups DC1,DC2 –Name TrioApart -Cluster Cluster1

Set-ClusterAffinityRule -Name Site1Trio -Enabled 1 -Cluster Cluster1

Set-ClusterAffinityRule -Name Site2Trio -Enabled 1 -Cluster Cluster1

Set-ClusterAffinityRule -Name TrioApart -Enabled 1 -Cluster Cluster1
```

To see the rules and how they are configured, use the **`Get-ClusterAffinityRule`** cmdlet without the `-Name` switch and you can see all rules created and their output.

```powershell
Get-ClusterAffinityRule -Cluster Cluster1

Name        RuleType               Groups            Enabled
----        --------               ------            -------
Site1Trio   SameFaultDomain        {SQL1, WEB1, DC1}    1
Site2Trio   SameFaultDomain        {SQL2, WEB2, DC2}    1
TrioApart   DifferentFaultDomain   {DC1, DC2}           1
```

## Storage affinity rules

You can also keep a VM and its VHDX on a Cluster Shared Volume (CSV) on the same cluster node. This would keep CSV redirection from occurring, which can slow down the starting or stopping of a VM.  Taking into account the combined affinity and anti-affinity scenario previously, you can keep the SQL VM and the Cluster Shared Volume on the same cluster node.  To do that, use the following commands:

```powershell
New-ClusterAffinityRule -Name SQL1CSV1 -Ruletype SameNode -Cluster Cluster1

New-ClusterAffinityRule -Name SQL2CSV2 -Ruletype SameNode -Cluster Cluster1

Add-ClusterGroupToAffinityRule -Groups SQL1 –Name SQL1CSV1 -Cluster Cluster1

Add-ClusterGroupToAffinityRule -Groups SQL2 –Name SQL2CSV2 -Cluster Cluster1

Add-ClusterSharedVolumeToAffinityRule -ClusterSharedVolumes CSV1 -Name SQL1CSV1 -Cluster Cluster1

Add-ClusterSharedVolumeToAffinityRule -ClusterSharedVolumes CSV2 -Name SQL2CSV2 -Cluster Cluster1

Set-ClusterAffinityRule -Name SQL1CSV1 -Enabled 1 -Cluster Cluster1

Set-ClusterAffinityRule -Name SQL2CSV2 -Enabled 1 -Cluster Cluster1
```

To see these rules and how they are configured, use the **`Get-ClusterAffinityRule`** cmdlet without the -Name switch and view the output.

```powershell
Get-ClusterAffinityRule -Cluster Cluster1

Name        RuleType               Groups            Enabled
----        --------               ------            -------
Site1Trio   SameFaultDomain        {SQL1, WEB1, DC1}    1
Site2Trio   SameFaultDomain        {SQL2, WEB2, DC2}    1
TrioApart   DifferentFaultDomain   {DC1, DC2}           1
SQL1CSV1    SameNode               {SQL1, <CSV1-GUID>}  1
SQL2CSV2    SameNode               {SQL2, <CSV2-GUID>}  1
```
