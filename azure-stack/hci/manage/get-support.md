# Get support for Azure Stack HCI

>Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2

This topic provides guidance on how to get support for the Azure Stack HCI operating system. Azure Stack HCI follows the same support process as Azure. Enterprise customers can follow the process described in [Create an Azure support request](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request). If you're a customer of a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), contact your CSP for support.

To create an Azure Stack HCI support request requires either a Standard or Professional Direct Azure Support Plan. Basic and Developer plans cannot be used.
