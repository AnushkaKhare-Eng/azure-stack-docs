# Review three-node storage switchless, dual TOR, dual link deployment network reference pattern for Azure Stack HCI

[!INCLUDE [includes](../../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)] and later

In this article, you learn about the three-node storage switchless with two TOR L3 switches and two full-mesh links network reference pattern that you can use to deploy your Azure Stack HCI solution.

For information on other network patterns, see [Azure Stack HCI network deployment patterns](choose-network-pattern.md).

## Scenarios

Scenarios for this network pattern include laboratories, factories, branch offices, and datacenters.

Consider implementing this pattern when looking for a cost-efficient solution that has fault tolerance across all the network components. It is possible to scale out the pattern, but it will require workloads downtime to reconfigure storage physical connectivity and storage networks reconfiguration. SDN L3 services are fully supported on this pattern. Routing services such as BGP can be configured directly on the TOR switches if they support L3 services. Network security features such as micro segmentation or QoS do not require additional configuration of the firewall device, as they are implemented at virtual network adapter layer.

## Physical connectivity components

As illustrated in the diagram above, this pattern has the following physical network components:

- For northbound/southbound communication the Azure Stack HCI cluster requires two TOR switches in MLAG configuration.

- Two network cards using SET virtual switch to handle management and compute traffic, connected to the TOR switches. Each NIC will be connected to a different TOR.

- Four RDMA NICs on each node in a full-mesh dual link configuration for East-West traffic for the storage. Each node in the cluster will have a redundant connection with two paths to the other node in the cluster.

|Networks|Management and compute|Storage|
|--|--|--|
|Link speed|At least 1 GBps. 10 GBps recommended|At least 10 GBps|
|Interface type|RJ45, SFP+ or SFP28|SFP+ or SFP28|
|Ports and aggregation|Two teamed ports|Four standalone ports|

## Logical networks

As illustrated in the diagram below, this pattern has the following logical network components:

:::image type="content" source="media/three-node-switchless-two-switches-dual-link/logical-components-layout.png" alt-text="Diagram showing three-node switchless, two TOR, dual link logical connectivity layout." lightbox="media/three-node-switchless-two-switches-dual-link/logical-components-layout.png":::

### Node interconnect networks VLAN for SMB traffic (Storage and live migration)

The Storage intent-based traffic will consist of six individual subnets supporting RDMA traffic. Each interface will be dedicated to a separate node interconnect network. This traffic is only intended to travel between the three nodes. Storage traffic on these subnets is isolated without connectivity to other resources.

Each pair of storge adapters between the nodes will operate in different IP subnets. To enable a switchless configuration, each connected node will support the same matching subnet of its neighbor. When deploying three nodes in a switchless configuration, Network ATC has the following requirements:

- Only supports a single VLAN for all the IP subnets used for storage connectivity.

- StorageAutoIP parameter must be set to false, Switchless parameter must be set to true,  and the customer is responsible to specify the IPs on the ARM template used to deploy the Azure Stack HCI version 23H2 cluster from Azure.

- In Azure Stack HCI 23H2 cloud deployments, scale out storage switchless clusters is not supported. For more information, see [Deploy via Azure Resource Manager deployment template](/deploy/deployment-azure-resource-manager-template.md).

- In Azure Stack HCI 23H2 cloud deployments, it is only possible to deploy this scenario using ARM templates. For more information, see [Deploy via Azure Resource Manager deployment template](/deploy/deployment-azure-resource-manager-template).

For more information, see [Network ATC overview](../concepts/network-atc-overview).

### Management VLAN

All physical compute hosts must access the management logical network. For IP address planning purposes, each host must have at least one IP address assigned from the management logical network.

A DHCP server can automatically assign IP addresses for the management network, or you can manually assign static IP addresses. When DHCP is the preferred IP assignment method, DHCP reservations without expiration are recommended.

For information, see [DHCP Network considerations for cloud deployment](cloud-deployment-network-considerations.md#dhcp-ip-assignment)

The management network supports two different VLAN configurations - Native or Tagged traffic:

- Native VLAN for management network does not require to supply a VLAN ID.

- Tagged VLAN for management network requires VLAN ID configuration on the physical network adapters or the management virtual network adapter before registering the nodes in Azure Arc. See more details in the link below.

- Physical switch ports must be configured correctly to accept the VLAN ID on the management adapters.

- If the intent includes management and compute traffic types, the physical switch ports must be configured in trunk mode to accept all the VLANs required for management and compute workloads.

The Management network supports traffic used by the administrator for management of the cluster including Remote Desktop, Windows Admin Center, and Active Directory.

For more information, see [Management VLAN network considerations](cloud-deployment-network-considerations.md#management-vlan-id).

### Compute VLANs

In some scenarios, you don’t need to use SDN Virtual Networks with VXLAN encapsulation. Instead, they can use traditional VLANs to isolate their tenant workloads. Those VLANs will need to be configured on the TOR switches port in trunk mode. When connecting new virtual machines to these VLANs, the corresponding VLAN tag will be defined on the virtual network adapter.

### HNV Provider Address (PA) network

The HNV Provider Address (PA) network serves as the underlying physical network for East/West (internal-internal) tenant traffic, North/South (external-internal) tenant traffic, and to exchange BGP peering information with the physical network. This network is only required when there is a need for deploying virtual networks using VXLAN encapsulation for an additional layer of isolation and network multitenancy.

For more information, see [Plan a Software Defined Network infrastructure](../concepts/plan-software-defined-networking-infrastructure#management-and-hnv-provider).

## Network ATC intents

For three-node storage switchless patterns, two Network ATC intents are created. The first for management and compute network traffic, and the second for storage traffic.

### Management and compute intent

- Intent Type: Management and Compute
- Intent Mode: Cluster mode
- Teaming: Yes. pNIC01 and pNIC02 Team
- Default Management VLAN: Configured VLAN for management adapters isn’t modified
- PA & Compute VLANs and vNICs: Network ATC is transparent to PA vNICs and VLAN or compute VM vNICs and VLANs

### Storage intent

- Intent type: Storage
- Intent mode: Cluster mode
- Teaming: No. RDMA NICs use SMB Multichannel to provide resiliency and bandwidth aggregation.
- Default VLANs: single VLAN for all subnets
- Storage Auto IP: False. This pattern requires manual IP configuration or ARM template IPs definition.

- Six subnets required (user defined):
    - Storage Network 1: 10.0.1.0/24 – Node1 -> Node2
    - Storage Network 2: 10.0.2.0/24 – Node1 -> Node2
    - Storage Network 3: 10.0.3.0/24 – Node2 -> Node3
    - Storage Network 4: 10.0.4.0/24 – Node1 -> Node3
    - Storage Network 5: 10.0.5.0/24 – Node1- > Node3
    - Storage Network 6: 10.0.6.0/24 – Node2 -> Node3
