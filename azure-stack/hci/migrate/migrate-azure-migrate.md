# Migrate Hyper-V VMs to Azure Stack HCI using Azure Migrate (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes how to migrate the Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs) to Azure Stack HCI using Azure Migrate and includes the steps to verify the migration.

[!INCLUDE [important](../../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## Before you begin

Before you migrate your VMs:

- Make sure that you have replicated the VM on your Azure Stack HCI cluster. To replicate a VM, use the instructions in [Replicate Hyper-V VMs to Azure Stack HCI using Azure Migrate](migrate-hyperv-replicate.md).
- Make sure the replication has completed and the migration status is **Ready to replicate**.


## Migrate VMs

1. In the Azure portal, go to your **Azure Migrate project > Servers, databases and webapps**.

1. On the **Migration tools** tile, select the number against **Azure Stack HCI** under **Replications**.

1. From the top command bar of the **Replications** page, select **Migrate** to migrate multiple VMs that are ready.

    Alternatively, you can select **Migrate** from the context menu for a single VM that is ready to migrate.

1. On the **Migrate** page:
    1. Review the details of the VM(s) that you want to migrate.
    1. Select whether or not you would like to shut down VM(s) before migration. We recommend that you shut down VMs as that ensures no data is lost.
    1. Select **Migrate** to start the migration. A notification appears that the migration has started.

1. Refresh the page periodically to view the migration status. You can also select the migration status at any time to view the progress details.

    The **Planned failover** blade indicates the various migration tasks in progress.

    The migration status changes from **Migration in progress** to **Completed** when the migration is complete.

Once the migration is complete, the VMs are running on your Azure Stack HCI cluster. You can view the VMs in the Azure portal.

 
## Verify migration

1. In the Azure portal, go to your **Azure Stack HCI resource > Virtual machines**.
1. In the list of VMs in the right-pane, verify that the VMs that you migrated are present.

1. Select a VM to view its details. Verify that the VM:
    1. The VM is running. The corresponding source VM in the Hyper-V server is turned off.
    1. The VM has the disk and network configuration as configured during replication.
  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/migrate-azure-migrate/verify-migrated-virtual-machine-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of migrated VM details in Azure portal." lightbox="./media/migrate-azure-migrate/verify-migrated-virtual-machine-2.png":::

1. Sign into the VM.
1. The VM behaves as expected.

1. In the Azure portal, select the ellipses ... next to the VM and select **Complete migration**.

    Alternatively, select the VM name.

    From the top command bar, select **Complete migration**. When prompted for confirmation, select **Yes** to continue. Repeat this action for all the migrated VMs.

    This action starts the **Delete protected item** job that you can track from the **Jobs** page. This job will only clean up the replication by deleting the delete protected item job - this will not affect your migrated VM.

    After the migrate resource is deleted, it is also removed from the **Replications** view. You'll also see the migrated VM job disappear from the **Replications** view.

## Clean up

Once you have verified that migration is complete and no more servers need to be migrated, the last step is to clean up. Clean up requires deletion of the following resources created during migration:

- Source VMs and the associated VM disks from the Hyper-V server and the Failover Cluster Manager.
- Source and target appliance VMs.

### Clean up VMs and associated disks

Clean up the source VMs. You can delete the source VMs from the Hyper-V server and the Failover Cluster Manager. When you delete a Hyper-V VM, only the VM configuration files are deleted. The virtual hard disks associated with the VM are not deleted. To clean up the VMs and the associated VM disks, follow these steps:

1. After the migration is complete, delete the source VM from Hyper-V server.
    1. In the Hyper-V manager, select the source VM that you migrated.
    1. Right-click the VM and select **Settings**.
    1. Select **Hard Drive** to copy the file path of the associated virtual hard disk. 
    1. Verify that the VM is turned off.
    1. Select the VM and right-click on the name of the VM. From the context menu, select **Delete...**. This action should delete the source VM.

        Alternatively, you can use PowerShell to delete the VM. For more information, see, [Delete VM from Hyper-V server](/powershell/module/hyper-v/remove-vm?view=windowsserver2022-ps&preserve-view=true).
    1. Navigate to the folder where the virtual hard disk of the VM is stored and delete the virtual hard disk.
1. The last step is to delete the VM from the Failover Cluster Manager.
    1. In the Failover Cluster Manager, connect to the Hyper-V cluster and go to **Roles**.
    1. Select the VM that you migrated. Verify that the VM is turned off.
    1. Right-click and from the context menu, select **Remove**. When prompted for confirmation, select **Yes** to continue. This action should delete the VM from the Failover Cluster Manager.
