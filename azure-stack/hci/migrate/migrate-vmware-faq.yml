    questions:
      - question: I have a VMware virtual machine (VM) running. How can I migrate this VM to my Azure Stack HCI cluster?
        answer: |
          The VMware VM requires ... 

      - question: I have Linux VMs running on my VMware server. Can I migrate these VMs to Azure Stack HCI?  
        answer: |
          Yes. There are many Linux distributions that can run on VMware VMs that will be migrated to Azure Stack HCI. For the full list, see [Supported operating systems](migrate-hyperv-requirements.md#supported-operating-systems). 

      - question: I have a VM running on an older VMware server. Can I migrate this VM to Azure Stack HCI?  
        answer: |
          Yes. The migration solution will discover VMs on all the VMware server hosts starting from ... 

      - question: I am located in a geography that is not in the listed supported geographies. Does this mean I can't use this migration solution?
        answer: |
          Yes. You can still use this solution. Just create the [Azure Migrate project](migrate-vmware-prerequisites.md#create-an-azure-migrate-project) and the [storage account](migrate-hyperv-prerequisites.md) in one of the [supported geographies](migrate-hyperv-requirements.md), since your migrated VMs can be in any geography. 

      - question: Will I be charged for this migration solution? 
        answer: |
          There are no tool usage charges for migration for 180 days. The time starts when you begin replicating the VMware VMs in your project.

          Migration requires some services like storage account and key vault that are created in your subscription. These services will accrue some charges.

      - question: My source VMs use static IP addresses. Will these addresses be preserved when I migrate my VMware VMs to Azure Stack HCI?
        answer: |
          Currently Hyper-V migration only supports VMs configured with DHCP. For a source VM with a static IP address, first migrate it to the target Azure Stack HCI system. After the migration, connect to the VM using Hyper-V Manager and manually change the IP configuration.  

      - question: I use DCHP reservation for IP addresses for my source VMs. Does migration ensure that the MAC address is preserved so that my migrated VM can get the same IP address? 
        answer: |
          This scenario is not supported in this release.

      - question: Are VMs that have secure boot enabled, supported for migration? 
        answer: |
          Both Linux and VMware VMs that have secure boot enabled, are not supported in this release.
