    questions:
      - question: I have a Windows Server 2008 R2 virtual machine (VM) running. How can I migrate this VM to my Azure Stack HCI cluster?
        answer: |
          The Windows Server 2008 R2 VM requires to have the Service Pack 1 (SP1) running as a baseline requirement, along with the following update patch installed: KB3138612. This patch allows the appliance to successfully discover Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 VMs. You can then update all the patches to get the latest Hyper-V integration services.
          
          Run `winrm quickconfig` to add `winrm` access through firewall as this doesn't happen automatically.

          After you replicate and migrate the VM, set the VM version to the latest supported version on the target. For Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2, it is version 10.
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > Migration is a one-way process and can't be reversed. The VM version canâ€™t be downgraded.

          To make sure that all the VMs are version 10, run the following cmdlet:

          ```PowerShell
          Get-VM * | Format-Table Name, Version
          ```

          Here's a sample output:

          ```output
          Name           Version
          -------------  ---------     
          migtarg01        10.0
          ws2019-01        10.0
          Centos9-01       10.0
          ws2008R2         10.0
          ```

      - question: My cluster shared volume (CSV) storage is full or almost full. What should I do?
