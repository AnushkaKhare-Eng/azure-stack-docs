title: FAQ - Migration of Hyper-V and VMware VMs to Azure Stack HCI using Azure Migrate (preview)

summary:
  The Azure Migrate based solution enables you to migrate VMs from Hyper-V and VMware to an Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 system.  This FAQ answers questions you might have about the migration of a VM from a Hyper-V or a VMware VM to an Azure Stack HCI cluster using Azure Migrate.
  Sections with tabs have questions that apply to **VMware and Hyper-V VMs**, **VMware VMs only**, and **Hyper-V VMs only**.

          ## [VMware and Hyper-V VMs](#tab/vmware-and-hyper-v-vms)
          
          ### I have a Windows Server 2008 R2 virtual machine (VM) running. How can I migrate this VM to my Azure Stack HCI cluster?
      
          The Windows Server 2008 R2 VM requires to have the Service Pack 1 (SP1) running as a baseline requirement, along with the following update patch installed: KB3138612. This patch allows the appliance to successfully discover Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 VMs. You can then update all the patches to get the latest Hyper-V integration services.
          
          Run `winrm quickconfig` to add `winrm` access through firewall as this doesn't happen automatically.

          After you replicate and migrate the VM, set the VM version to the latest supported version on the target. For Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2, it's version 10.
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > Migration is a one-way process and can't be reversed. The VM version can't be downgraded.

          To make sure that all the VMs are version 10, run the following cmdlet:

          ```PowerShell
          Get-VM * | Format-Table Name, Version
          ```
          Here's a sample output:

          ```output
          Name           Version
          -------------  ---------     
          migtarg01        10.0
          ws2019-01        10.0
          Centos9-01       10.0
          ws2008R2         10.0
          ```
          
          ### My cluster shared volume (CSV) storage is full or almost full. What should I do?

          Expand your cluster shared volume. Follow the instructions in [Expand volumes on Azure Stack HCI and Windows Server clusters](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2013/01/how-to-make-an-existing-hyper-v-virtual-machine-highly-available/).

          ### How do I remove the target appliance from Azure Migrate project?

          To remove the target appliance from the project and create a new appliance, run the following command:

          ```PowerShell
          .\AzureMigrateInstaller.ps1 -RemoveAzMigrate
          ```

          After removing the appliance, follow the instructions in the deployment PowerPoint to install it again.

          ### I have Linux VMs running on my Hyper-V server. Can I migrate these VMs to Azure Stack HCI?

          Yes. There are many Linux distributions that can run on VMs that are migrated to Azure Stack HCI. For the full list, see [Supported operating systems](migrate-hyperv-requirements.md#supported-operating-systems). 

          ### I have a VM running on an older Hyper-V host server, for example, Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2008 R2. Can I migrate this VM to Azure Stack HCI?

          Yes. The migration solution discovers VMs on all the Windows Server hosts starting from Windows Server 2012 R2 and up to Windows Server 2022.

          ### I'm located in a geography that isn't in the listed supported geographies. Does this mean I can't use this migration solution?

          Yes. You can still use this solution. Just create the [Azure Migrate project](migrate-hyperv-prerequisites.md#create-an-azure-migrate-project) and the [storage account](migrate-hyperv-prerequisites.md) in one of the [supported geographies](migrate-hyperv-requirements.md), since your migrated VMs can be in any geography. 

          ### Will I be charged for this migration solution? 
        
          There are no tool usage charges for migration for 180 days. The time starts when you begin replicating the VMs in your project.

          Migration requires some services like storage account and key vault that are created in your subscription. These services accrue some charges.

          ### To install the source or target appliance with the downloaded .zip file, I need a Windows Server 2022 operating system (OS). How can I get the Windows Server 2022 OS?
        
          You can use your own licensed images to install these appliances. You can also use a Windows Server 2022 [evaluation version](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022) for free for up to 180 days.

          ### My source VMs use static IP addresses. Will these addresses be preserved when I migrate my VMs to Azure Stack HCI?
        
          Currently Hyper-V migration only supports VMs configured with DHCP. For a source VM with a static IP address, first migrate it to the target Azure Stack HCI system. After the migration, connect to the VM using Hyper-V Manager and manually change the IP configuration.  

          ### I use DCHP reservation for IP addresses for my source VMs. Does migration ensure that the MAC address is preserved so that my migrated VM can get the same IP address? 
        
          This scenario isn't supported in this release.

          ### Are VMs that have secure boot enabled, supported for migration? 
        
          Both Linux and Windows VMs that have secure boot enabled, aren't supported in this release.

          ## [VMware VMs only](#tab/vmware-vms)
          
          ### How many VMs can I replicate in parallel from VMware?

          Within the Azure Migrate portal, you can select up to 10 machines at once for replication. To replicate more machines, add in batches of 10 (agentless migration overview).

          Each Azure migrate appliance supports replication of 52 disks in parallel (scheduling logic).

          For example, if you selected to replicate 100 VMs (in batches of 10), with each VM containing two disks each, resulting in 200 (100 x 2) disks in total. The Azure migrate appliance starts replicating 52 disks in parallel. As soon as one disk finishes initial replication, the next disk immediately takes its spot in the queue, while still continuously replicating the remaining 52 disks. This continues with all the remaining disks until all 200 disks have been replicated.

          ## [Hyper-V VMs only](#tab/hyper-v-vms)
          
          ### I have a VM running on an older Hyper-V host server - for example, Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2008 R2. Can I migrate this VM to Azure Stack HCI?

          Yes. The migration solution discovers VMs on all the Windows Server hosts starting from Windows Server 2012 R2 and up to Windows Server 2022.
