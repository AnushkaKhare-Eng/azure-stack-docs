    questions:
      - question: I have a Windows Server 2008 R2 virtual machine (VM) running. How can I migrate this VM to my Azure Stack HCI cluster?
        answer: |
          The Windows Server 2008 R2 VM requires to have the Service Pack 1 (SP1) running as a baseline requirement, along with the following update patch installed: KB3138612. This patch allows the appliance to successfully discover Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 VMs. You can then update all the patches to get the latest Hyper-V integration services.
          
          Run `winrm quickconfig` to add `winrm` access through firewall as this doesn't happen automatically.

          After you replicate and migrate the VM, set the VM version to the latest supported version on the target. For Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2, it's version 10.
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > Migration is a one-way process and can't be reversed. The VM version canâ€™t be downgraded.

          To make sure that all the VMs are version 10, run the following cmdlet:

          ```PowerShell
          Get-VM * | Format-Table Name, Version
          ```

          Here's a sample output:

          ```output
          Name           Version
          -------------  ---------     
          migtarg01        10.0
          ws2019-01        10.0
          Centos9-01       10.0
          ws2008R2         10.0
          ```

      - question: My cluster shared volume (CSV) storage is full or almost full. What should I do? 
        answer: |
          Expand your cluster shared volume. Follow the instructions in [Expand volumes on Azure Stack HCI and Windows Server clusters](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2013/01/how-to-make-an-existing-hyper-v-virtual-machine-highly-available/).
          
      - question: How do I remove the target appliance from Azure Migrate project?
        answer: |
          To remove the target appliance from the project and create a new appliance, run the following command:

          ```PowerShell
          .\AzureMigrateInstaller.ps1 -RemoveAzMigrate
          ```

          After removing the appliance, follow the instructions in the deployment PowerPoint to install it again.

      - question: I have Linux VMs, can I migrate them to Azure Stack HCI?  
        answer: |
          Yes, certainly. Lots of Linux distributions are supported to be migrated to Azure Stack HCI, for the full list see [Supported operating systems](migrate-hyperv-requirements.md#supported-operating-systems). 

      - question: I have VM running on older Hyper-V host servers especially on Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2008 R2, can I migrate these VM to Azure Stack HCI?  
        answer: |
          Definitely! All Windows Server hosts starting with Windows Server 2012 up to Windows Server 2022 are supported. 

      - question: I am located in a geography that is not in the listed [supported geographies](migrate-hyperv-requirements.md#supported-geographies), does this mean I can't use Hyper-V migration to Azure Stack HCI with Azure Migrate?  
        answer: |
          Yes you can still use it, you just need to create the [Azure Migrate project](migrate-hyperv-prerequisites.md#create-an-azure-migrate-project) and the [storage account](migrate-hyperv-prerequisites.md#create-an-azure-storage-account) in one of the supported geographies, but your migrated VMs can be in any geography.  

      - question: Is this migration a free service? 
        answer: |
          There are no tool usage charges for migration for 180 days, from the time replication is started for a VM. Migration requires some services like [storage account](migrate-hyperv-prerequisites.md#create-an-azure-storage-account) and key vault which needs to be created at customer's subscription, there will be some minimal amounts charged for those services. 

      - question: I see that if I download a .zip file for the source or target appliance installation, I need a Windows Server 2022 operating system (OS) so that I can install these  appliances. Where can I get Windows Server 2022? 
        answer: |
          Usually customers use their own corporate images for these appliances but you can also use an [evaluation version](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022) for free for 180 days.
