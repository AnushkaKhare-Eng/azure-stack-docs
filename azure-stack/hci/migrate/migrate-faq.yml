          ### What is Azure Data Box service? 
          
          Azure Data Box service is designed for offline data ingestion. This service manages an array of products of differing storage capacities, all tailored for data transport. 
            
          ### What is Azure Data Box?
          
          Azure Data Box allows a quick, inexpensive, and secure transfer of terabytes of data into Azure. You order the Data Box device via the Azure portal. Microsoft ships you a storage device through a regional carrier.

          ### Which Data Box model should I use?

           If you have 40 - 500 TB of data that you want to transfer to or from Azure, you would benefit from using Data Box. For data sizes < 40 TB, use [Data Box Disk](data-box-overview.md), and for data sizes > 500 TB, sign up for [Data Box Heavy](data-box-heavy-overview.md).

          ### What is the price of Data Box?

           Data Box is available at a nominal charge for 10 days. When you select the product model while creating an order in the Azure portal, the charges for the device are displayed. Standard shipping charges and charges for Azure storage also apply. Export orders follow a similar pricing model as for import orders, though additional egress charges may apply.

          For more information, go to [Azure Data Box pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/databox/) and [Azure Data Box Heavy pricing]( https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/databox/heavy/). For egress charges, see [Bandwidth pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/).

          ### Can I use a Data Box to import or export data from the country/region where Iâ€™m located to a different country/region?

           Data Box supports data ingestion or egress only within the same country/region as the destination and won't cross any international borders. The only exception is for orders in the European Union (EU), where Data Boxes can ship to and from any EU country/region.

          For example, working with an import in Data Box, if you wanted to move source data in Canada to an Azure West US storage account, you could do that in the following way:

          1. Order Data Box in Canada by choosing a storage account in Canada. The device is shipped from an Azure datacenter in Canada to the shipping address, also in Canada, that you provided when you created the order.

          2. Once the on-premises data copy to the Data Box is done, return the device to the Azure datacenter in Canada. The data on the Data Box then gets uploaded to the destination storage account in the Canada Azure region that you chose.

          3. You can then use a tool like AzCopy to copy the data from the storage account in Canada to a storage account in West US. This step incurs [standard storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/) and [bandwidth charges](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/) that aren't included in the Data Box billing.

          ### Does Data Box store any customer data outside the service region?

           No. Data Box doesn't store any customer data outside of the service region. The customer has full ownership of their data. They can save the data to a specified location based on the storage account they select during the order creation.

          In addition to the customer data, there's Data Box data that includes security artifacts related to the device, monitoring logs for the device and the service, and service-related metadata. In all regions (except Brazil South, Southeast Asia, and East Asia), Data Box data is stored and replicated in the paired region via a Geo-redundant Storage account to protect against data loss.

          Due to [data residency requirements](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/data-residency/#more-information) in Brazil South, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, Data Box data is stored in a Zone-redundant Storage (ZRS) account so that it's contained in a single region. For Southeast Asia, all the Data Box data is stored in Singapore. For Brazil South, the data is stored in Brazil. For East Asia, the data is stored in Hong Kong SAR.

          If there's a service outage in Brazil South, Southeast Asia, or East Asia, the customers can create new orders from another region. The new orders are served from the region in which they're created and the customers are responsible for the to and fro shipment of the Data Box device.

          ### Does my Data Box region have to be in the same Azure region as my destination storage account?

           No. The Data Box resource doesn't need to be the same as the storage account region where you want to transfer data. You can choose a storage account in any region within the country or commerce boundary selected during the order. The Data Box region is only used to deploy the resource during order creation. This is fixed for each country or commerce boundary and can't be changed.

          ### How can I recover my data if an entire region fails?

          In extreme circumstances where a region is lost because of a significant disaster, Microsoft may initiate a regional failover. No action on your part is required in this case. Your order is fulfilled through the failover region if it is within the same country or commerce boundary. However, some Azure regions don't have a paired region in the same geographic or commerce boundary. If there's a disaster in any of those regions, you'll need to create the Data Box order again from a different region that is available, and copy the data to Azure in the new region. For more information, see [Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR): Azure Paired Regions](../best-practices-availability-paired-regions.md).

          ### Who should I contact if I come across any issues with Data Box?

           If you come across any issues with Data Box, [contact Microsoft Support](data-box-disk-contact-microsoft-support.md).

          ### I lost my Data Box. Is there a lost device charge?

          Yes. There's a charge for a lost or damaged device. This charge is covered on the [Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/databox/) and in the [Product Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products). Scroll down to "Frequently asked questions" for the product and look for "Lost device fee."
