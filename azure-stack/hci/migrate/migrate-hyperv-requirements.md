# System requirements for Hyper-V VM migration to Azure Stack HCI using Azure Migrate (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes the system requirements for Hyper-V virtual machine (VM) migration to Azure Stack HCI using Azure Migrate.

## Supported operating systems

The following operating systems are supported for the Azure Migrate source appliance and the target appliance, and for the guest VMs that you are migrating. For more information on the terminology used, see Appendix: Terminology.

|Source appliance|Target appliance|Guest VMs|
|---|--|--|
|Windows Server 2016|Windows Server 2022|**Windows server guest VMs**:<br>- Windows server 2022<br>- Windows Server 2019<br>- Windows Server 2016<br>- Windows Server 2012 R2<br>- Windows Server 2008 R2<br>**Linux guest VMs**:<br>- Red Hat Linux 6.x, 7.x<br>- Ubuntu Server and Pro. 18.x<br>- CentOS 7.x<br>- SUSE Linux Enterprise 12.x<br>- Debian 9.x|

## Region requirements

The following Azure regions are supported for your Azure Migrate service:

|Country|Supported regions|
|-|-|
|US|Central US|
|Europe|West Europe|

## Azure portal requirements

|Level|Permissions|
|-|-|
|Tenant|Application administrator permissions|
|Subscription|Contributor and User Access Administrator permissions|

## Source Hyper-V cluster and VM requirements

Scale-Out File Server (SOFS) is not supported in Public Preview. If the VM disks are on a SOFS, you canâ€™t migrate those VMs with the Public Preview.

## Target Azure Stack HCI cluster and VM requirements

- The target Azure Stack HCI cluster HCI version must be the 23H2 supplemental package release or the [latest release](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure-stack/hci/release-information#azure-stack-hci-version-22h2-os-build-20349).

- Standalone VMs on standalone (non-clustered) Hyper-V hosts can be discovered and migrated however, standalone VMs hosted on "clustered" Hyper-V hosts cannot be discovered and migrated. To migrate these VMs they need to be [made highly available](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2013/01/how-to-make-an-existing-hyper-v-virtual-machine-highly-available/).

- Before you migrate, for all the Windows VMs, bring all the disks online and persist the drive letter. For more information, see how to [configure a SAN policy](/azure/migrate/prepare-for-migration#configure-san-policy) to bring disks online.

## Agent and service requirements

Make sure that the source appliance VM and the target appliance VM have a healthy configuration by ensuring the following agents and services are running:

1. On the source appliance VM (also known as Azure Migrate appliance):
  
     - Microsoft Azure Gateway Service (*asrgwy*)
     - Microsoft Azure Hyper-V Discovery Service (*amhvdiscoverysvc*)
     - Azure Site Recovery Management Service (*asrmgmtsvc*)

    Logs and configuration can be found at:

        C:\ProgramData\Microsoft Azure\Logs

        C:\ProgramData\Microsoft Azure\Config

1. On the target appliance VM
 
     - Microsoft Azure Gateway Service (*asrgwy*)
     - Azure Site Recovery Management Service (*asrmgmtsvc*)
    
    Logs and configuration can be found at:

        C:\ProgramData\Microsoft Azure\Logs

        C:\ProgramData\Microsoft Azure\Config

The Arc Resource Bridge must be configured and running on the target appliance VM. Use the instructions in the deployment PowerPoint to install the Arc Resource Bridge, and make sure that you have the following configured:

- Arc Resource Bridge must have virtual network configured.

- Arc Resource Bridge must have storage path(s) configured.

- Arc Resource Bridge agent logs can be captured by running these PowerShell cmdlets:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-MocLogs
    Get-MocEventLog
    Get-ArcHciLogs
    ```
