# Create an Azure Stack HCI cluster using Windows PowerShell

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version v20H2

In this article you will learn how to use Windows PowerShell to create an Azure Stack HCI hyperconverged cluster that uses Storage Spaces Direct. If you're rather use the Cluster Creation wizard in Windows Admin Center to create the cluster, see [Create the cluster with Windows Admin Center](create-cluster.md).

You have a choice between two cluster types:

- Standard cluster with at least two server nodes, all residing in a single site.
- Stretched cluster with at least four server nodes that span across two sites, with two nodes per site.

In this article, we will create an example cluster named Cluster1 that is composed of four server nodes named Server1, Server2, Server3, and Server4.

For the stretched cluster scenario, we will use ClusterS1 as the name and use the same four server nodes stretched across sites Site1 and Site2.

For more information about stretched clusters, see [Stretched clusters overview](../concepts/stretched-clusters.md).

If you’re interested in testing Azure Stack HCI, but have limited or no spare hardware, check out the [Azure Stack HCI Evaluation Guide](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStackHCI-EvalGuide/blob/main/README.md), where we’ll walk you through experiencing Azure Stack HCI using nested virtualization, either in Azure, or on a single physical system on-premises.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you:

- Have read the [Azure Stack HCI system requirements](../concepts/system-requirements.md).
- Have read the [Physical network requirements](../concepts/physical-network-requirements.md) and [Host network requirements](../concepts/host-network-requirements.md) for Azure Stack HCI.
- Install the Azure Stack HCI OS on each server in the cluster. See [Deploy the Azure Stack HCI operating system](operating-system.md).
- Have an account that’s a member of the local Administrators group on each server.
- Have rights in Active Directory to create objects.
- For stretched clusters, set up your two sites beforehand in Active Directory.

## Using Windows PowerShell

You can either run PowerShell locally in an RDP session on a host server, or you can run PowerShell remotely from a management computer. This article will cover the remote option.

When running PowerShell from a management computer, include the `-Name` or `-Cluster` parameter with the name of the server or cluster you are managing. In addition, you may need to specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) when using the `-ComputerName` parameter for a server node.

You will also need the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) cmdlets and PowerShell modules for Hyper-V and Failover Clustering. If these aren't already available in your PowerShell session on your management computer, you can add them using the following command: `Add-WindowsFeature RSAT-Clustering-PowerShell`.

## Step 1: Provision the servers

First we will connect to each of the servers, join them to a domain (the same domain the management computer is in), and install required roles and features.

### Step 1.1: Connect to the servers

To connect to the servers, you must first have network connectivity, be joined to the same domain or a fully trusted domain, and have local administrative permissions to the servers.

Open PowerShell and use either the fully-qualified domain name or the IP address of the server you want to connect to. You'll be prompted for a password after you run the following command on each server. 

For this example, we assume that the servers have been named Server1, Server2, Server3, and Server4:

   ```powershell
   Enter-PSSession -ComputerName "Server1" -Credential "Server1\Administrator"
   ```

Here's another example of doing the same thing:

   ```powershell
   $myServer1 = "Server1"
   $user = "$myServer1\Administrator"

   Enter-PSSession -ComputerName $myServer1 -Credential $user
   ```

> [!TIP]
> When running PowerShell commands from your management PC, you might get an error like *WinRM cannot process the request.* To fix this, use PowerShell to add each server to the Trusted Hosts list on your management computer. This list supports wildcards, like `Server*` for example.
>
> `Set-Item WSMAN:\Localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value Server1 -Force`
>  
> To view your Trusted Hosts list, type `Get-Item WSMAN:\Localhost\Client\TrustedHosts`.  
>
> To empty the list, type `Clear-Item WSMAN:\Localhost\Client\TrustedHost`.  

### Step 1.2: Join the domain and add domain accounts

So far you've connected to each server node with the local administrator account `<ServerName>\Administrator`.

To proceed, you'll need to join the servers to a domain and use the domain account that is in the local Administrators group on every server.

Use the `Enter-PSSession` cmdlet to connect to each server and  run the following cmdlet, substituting the server name, domain name, and domain credentials:

```powershell  
Add-Computer -NewName "Server1" -DomainName "contoso.com" -Credential "Contoso\User" -Restart -Force  
```

If your administrator account isn't a member of the Domain Admins group, add your administrator account to the local Administrators group on each server - or better yet, add the group you use for administrators. You can use the following command to do so:

```powershell
Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators" -Member "king@contoso.local"
```

### Step 1.3: Install roles and features

The next step is to install required Windows roles and features on every server for the cluster. Here are the roles to install:

- BitLocker
- Data Center Bridging (for RoCEv2 network adapters)
- Failover Clustering
- File Server
- FS-Data-Deduplication module
- Hyper-V
- Hyper-V PowerShell
- RSAT-AD-Clustering-PowerShell module
- RSAT-AD-PowerShell module
- Storage Replica (for stretched clusters)

Use the following command for each server:

```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature -ComputerName "Server1" -Name "BitLocker", "Data-Center-Bridging", "Failover-Clustering", "FS-FileServer", "FS-Data-Deduplication", "Hyper-V", "Hyper-V-PowerShell", "RSAT-AD-Powershell", "RSAT-Clustering-PowerShell", "Storage-Replica" -IncludeAllSubFeature -IncludeManagementTools
```

To run the command on all servers in the cluster at the same time, use the following script, modifying the list of variables at the beginning to fit your environment:

```powershell
# Fill in these variables with your values
$ServerList = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3", "Server4"
$FeatureList = "BitLocker", "Data-Center-Bridging", "Failover-Clustering", "FS-FileServer", "FS-Data-Deduplication", "Hyper-V", "Hyper-V-PowerShell", "RSAT-AD-Powershell", "RSAT-Clustering-PowerShell", "Storage-Replica"

# This part runs the Install-WindowsFeature cmdlet on all servers in $ServerList, passing the list of features in $FeatureList.
Invoke-Command ($ServerList) {
    Install-WindowsFeature -Name $Using:Featurelist -IncludeAllSubFeature -IncludeManagementTools
}
```
Next, restart all the servers:

```powershell
$ServerList = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3", "Server4"
Restart-Computer -ComputerName $ServerList -WSManAuthentication Kerberos
```

## Step 2: Configure networking

This step configures various networking elements, such as virtual switches and network adapters, in your environment. RDMA (both iWARP and RoCE) network adapters are supported.

For more information on RDMA and Hyper-V host networking for Azure Stack HCI, see [Host network requirements](../concepts/host-network-requirements.md).

### Disable unused network adapters

You must disable any disconnected networks and adapters not used for management, storage or for workload traffic such as VMs. This includes network adapters used for headless management such as baseboard management controllers (BMCs).

Here is how to identify unused networks:

```powershell
$ServerList = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3", "Server4"
Get-NetAdapter -CimSession $ServerList | Where-Object Status -eq Disconnected
```
And here is how to disable them:

```powershell
Get-NetAdapter -CimSession $ServerList | Where-Object Status -eq Disconnected | Disable-NetAdapter -Confirm:$False
```

### Create virtual switches

A virtual switch is needed for each server node in your cluster. In the following example, a virtual switch with SR-IOV capability is created using network adapters that are connected (Status is UP). SR-IOV enabled might also be useful as it's required for RDMA enabled vmNICs (vNICs for VMs).

All network adapters must be identical for teaming NICs together.

```powershell
$ServerList = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3", "Server4"
$vSwitchName="vSwitch"
```

And to create the virtual switch:

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $ServerList -ScriptBlock {New-VMSwitch -Name $using:vSwitchName -EnableEmbeddedTeaming $TRUE -EnableIov $true -NetAdapterName (Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object Status -eq Up ).InterfaceAlias}
```

Now, validate that the switch has been successfully created:

```powershell
$ServerList = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3", "Server4"
Get-VMSwitch -CimSession $ServerList | Select-Object Name, IOVEnabled, IOVS*
Get-VMSwitchTeam -CimSession $ServerList
```

### Assign virtual network adapters

Next, you will assign virtual network adapters (vNICs) for management and the rest of your traffic, as in the following example. You must configure at least one network adapter for cluster management.

```powershell
$ServerList = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3", "Server4"
$vSwitchName="vSwitch"
Rename-VMNetworkAdapter -ManagementOS -Name $vSwitchName -NewName Management -ComputerName $ServerList
Add-VMNetworkAdapter -ManagementOS -Name SMB01 -SwitchName $vSwitchName -CimSession $ServerList
Add-VMNetworkAdapter -ManagementOS -Name SMB02 -SwitchName $vSwitchName -Cimsession $ServerList
```

And verify they have been successfully added and assigned:

```powershell
$ServerList = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3", "Server4"
Get-VMNetworkAdapter -CimSession $ServerList -ManagementOS
```

### Configure IP addresses and VLANs

You can configure either one or two subnets. Two subnets are preferred if you want to prevent overloading of the switch interconnect. For example, SMB storage traffic will stay on a subnet that's dedicated to one physical switch.

> [!NOTE]
> While configuring IP addresses, the connection may be interrupted for a few minutes as you might be connected to one of the virtual adapters while obtaining a new IP address.

#### Obtain network interface information

Before you can set IP addresses for the network interface cards, there is some information you need first, such as Interface Index (`ifIndex`), `Interface Alias`, and `Address Family`. Write these down for each server node as you will need them later.

Run the following:

```powershell
$ServerList = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3", "Server4"
Get-NetIPInterface -CimSession $ServerList
```

#### Configure one subnet

```powershell
$ServerList = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3", "Server4"
$StorNet="172.16.1."
$StorVLAN=1
$IP=1 #starting IP Address

#Configure IP Addresses
foreach ($Server in $ServerList){
    New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress ($StorNet+$IP.ToString()) -InterfaceAlias "vEthernet (SMB01)" -CimSession $Server -PrefixLength 24
    $IP++
    New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress ($StorNet+$IP.ToString()) -InterfaceAlias "vEthernet (SMB02)" -CimSession $Server -PrefixLength 24
    $IP++
}

#Configure VLANs
Set-VMNetworkAdapterVlan -VMNetworkAdapterName SMB01 -VlanId $StorVLAN -Access -ManagementOS -CimSession $ServerList
#Restart each host vNIC adapter so that the Vlan is active.
Restart-NetAdapter "vEthernet (SMB01)" -CimSession $ServerList
Restart-NetAdapter "vEthernet (SMB02)" -CimSession $ServerList
```

#### Configure two subnets

```powershell
$ServerList = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3", "Server4"
$StorNet1="172.16.1."
$StorNet2="172.16.2."
$StorVLAN1=1
$StorVLAN2=2
$IP=1 #starting IP Address

#Configure IP Addresses
foreach ($Server in $ServerList){
    New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress ($StorNet1+$IP.ToString()) -InterfaceAlias "vEthernet (SMB01)" -CimSession $Server -PrefixLength 24
    New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress ($StorNet2+$IP.ToString()) -InterfaceAlias "vEthernet (SMB02)" -CimSession $Server -PrefixLength 24
    $IP++
}

#Configure VLANs
Set-VMNetworkAdapterVlan -VMNetworkAdapterName SMB01 -VlanId $StorVLAN1 -Access -ManagementOS -CimSession $ServerList
Set-VMNetworkAdapterVlan -VMNetworkAdapterName SMB02 -VlanId $StorVLAN2 -Access -ManagementOS -CimSession $ServerList
#Restart each host vNIC adapter so that the Vlan is active.
Restart-NetAdapter "vEthernet (SMB01)" -CimSession $Servers
Restart-NetAdapter "vEthernet (SMB02)" -CimSession $Servers
```

#### Verify VLAN IDs and subnets

```powershell
$ServerList = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3", "Server4"
#verify ip config
Get-NetIPAddress -CimSession $ServerList -InterfaceAlias vEthernet* -AddressFamily IPv4 | Sort-Object -Property PSComputername | ft pscomputername,interfacealias,ipaddress -AutoSize -GroupBy PSComputerName

#Verify that the VlanID is set
Get-VMNetworkAdapterVlan -ManagementOS -CimSession $ServerList | Sort-Object -Property Computername | Format-Table ComputerName,AccessVlanID,ParentAdapter -AutoSize -GroupBy ComputerName
```

## Step 3: Prep for cluster setup

Next, verify that your servers are ready for clustering. As a sanity check first, consider running the following commands to make sure that the servers don't already belong to a cluster:

Use `Get-ClusterNode` to show all nodes:

```powershell
Get-ClusterNode
```

Use `Get-ClusterResource` to show all cluster nodes:

```powershell
Get-ClusterResource
```

Use `Get-ClusterNetwork` to show all cluster networks:

```powershell
Get-ClusterNetwork
```

### Step 3.1: Prepare drives

Before you enable Storage Spaces Direct, ensure your permanent drives are empty. Run the following script to remove any old partitions or other data.

> [!NOTE]
> Exclude any removable drives attached to a server node from the script. If you are running this script locally from a server node for example, you don't want to wipe the removable drive you might be using to deploy the cluster.

```powershell
# Fill in these variables with your values
$ServerList = "Server1", "Server2", "Server3", "Server4"

Invoke-Command ($ServerList) {
    Update-StorageProviderCache
    Get-StoragePool | ? IsPrimordial -eq $false | Set-StoragePool -IsReadOnly:$false -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    Get-StoragePool | ? IsPrimordial -eq $false | Get-VirtualDisk | Remove-VirtualDisk -Confirm:$false -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    Get-StoragePool | ? IsPrimordial -eq $false | Remove-StoragePool -Confirm:$false -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    Get-PhysicalDisk | Reset-PhysicalDisk -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    Get-Disk | ? Number -ne $null | ? IsBoot -ne $true | ? IsSystem -ne $true | ? PartitionStyle -ne RAW | % {
        $_ | Set-Disk -isoffline:$false
        $_ | Set-Disk -isreadonly:$false
        $_ | Clear-Disk -RemoveData -RemoveOEM -Confirm:$false
        $_ | Set-Disk -isreadonly:$true
        $_ | Set-Disk -isoffline:$true
    }
    Get-Disk | Where Number -Ne $Null | Where IsBoot -Ne $True | Where IsSystem -Ne $True | Where PartitionStyle -Eq RAW | Group -NoElement -Property FriendlyName
} | Sort -Property PsComputerName, Count
```

### Step 3.2: Test cluster configuration

In this step, you'll ensure that the server nodes are configured correctly to create a cluster. The `Test-Cluster` cmdlet is used to run tests to verify your configuration is suitable to function as a hyperconverged cluster. The example below uses the `-Include` parameter, with the specific categories of tests specified. This ensures that the correct tests are included in the validation.

```powershell
Test-Cluster –Node $ServerList –Include "Storage Spaces Direct", "Inventory", "Network", "System Configuration"
```

## Step 4: Create the cluster

You are now ready to create a cluster with the server nodes that you have validated in the preceding steps.

When creating the cluster, you'll get a warning that states - `"There were issues while creating the clustered role that may prevent it from starting. For more information, view the report file below."` You can safely ignore this warning. It's due to no disks being available for the cluster witness that you will create later. 

> [!NOTE]
> If the servers are using static IP addresses, modify the following command to reflect the static IP address by adding the following parameter and specifying the IP address: `–StaticAddress <X.X.X.X>;`.

```powershell
$ClusterName="cluster1" New-Cluster -Name $ClusterName –Node $ServerList –nostorage
```

Congrats, your cluster has now been created.

After the cluster is created, it can some take time for the cluster name to be replicated via DNS across your domain, especially if workgroup servers have been newly added to Active Directory. Although the cluster might be displayed in Windows Admin Center, it might not be available to connect to yet.

A good check to ensure all cluster resources are online:

```powershell
Get-Cluster -Name $ClusterName | Get-ClusterResource
```

If resolving the cluster isn't successful after some time, in most cases you can connect by using the name of one of the clustered servers instead of the cluster name.

## Step 5: Set up sites (stretched cluster)

This task only applies if you are creating a stretched cluster between two sites. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you have set up Active Directory Sites and Services beforehand, you do not need to create the sites manually as described below.

### Step 5.1: Create sites

In the cmdlet below, *FaultDomain* is simply another name for a site. This example uses "ClusterS1" as the name of the stretched cluster.

```powershell
New-ClusterFaultDomain -CimSession "ClusterS1" -FaultDomainType Site -Name "Site1"
```

```powershell
New-ClusterFaultDomain -CimSession "ClusterS1" -FaultDomainType Site -Name "Site2"
```

Use the `Get-ClusterFaultDomain` cmdlet to verify that both sites have been created for the cluster.

```powershell
New-ClusterFaultDomain -CimSession "ClusterS1"
```

### Step 5.2: Assign server nodes

Next, we will assign the four server nodes to their respective sites. In the example below, Server1 and Server2 are assigned to Site1, while Server3 and Server4 are assigned to Site2.

```powershell
Set-ClusterFaultDomain -CimSession "ClusterS1" -Name "Server1", "Server2" -Parent "Site1"
```

```powershell
Set-ClusterFaultDomain -CimSession "ClusterS1" -Name "Server3", "Server4" -Parent "Site2"
```

Using the `Get-ClusterFaultDomain` cmdlet, verify the nodes are in the correct sites.

```powershell
Get-ClusterFaultDomain -CimSession "ClusterS1"
```

### Step 5.3: Set a preferred site

You can also define a global *preferred* site, which means that specified resources and groups must run on the preferred site.  This setting can be defined at the site level using the following command:  

```powershell
(Get-Cluster).PreferredSite = "Site1"
```

Specifying a preferred Site for stretched clusters has the following benefits:

- **Cold start** - during a cold start, virtual machines are placed in the preferred site

- **Quorum voting**
  - Using a dynamic quorum, weighting is decreased from the passive (replicated) site first to ensure that the preferred site survives if all other things are equal. In addition, server nodes are pruned from the passive site first during regrouping after events such as an asymmetric network connectivity failures.

  - During a quorum split of two sites, if the cluster witness cannot be contacted, the preferred site is automatically elected to win. The server nodes in the passive site then drop out of cluster membership. This allows the cluster to survive a simultaneous 50% loss of votes.

The preferred site can also be configured at the cluster role or group level. In this case, a different preferred site can be configured for each virtual machine group. This enables a site to be active and preferred for specific virtual machines.

## Step 6: Enable Storage Spaces Direct

After creating the cluster, use the `Enable-ClusterStorageSpacesDirect` cmdlet, which will enable Storage Spaces Direct and do the following automatically:

- **Create a storage pool:** Creates a storage pool for the cluster that has a name like "Cluster1 Storage Pool".

- **Create a Cluster Performance History disk:** Creates a Cluster Performance History virtual disk in the storage pool.

- **Create data and log volumes:** Creates a data volume and a log volume in the storage pool.

- **Configure Storage Spaces Direct caches:** If there is more than one media (drive) type available for Storage Spaces Direct, it enables the fastest as cache devices (read and write in most cases).

- **Create tiers:** Creates two tiers as default tiers. One is called "Capacity" and the other called "Performance". The cmdlet analyzes the devices and configures each tier with the mix of device types and resiliency.

For stretched clusters, the `Enable-ClusterStorageSpacesDirect` cmdlet will also do the following:

- Check to see if sites have been set up
- Determine which nodes are in which sites
- Determines what storage each node has available
- Checks to see if the Storage Replica feature is installed on each node
- Creates a storage pool for each site and identifies it with the name of the site
- Creates data and log volumes in each storage pool - one per site

The following command enables Storage Spaces Direct. You can also specify a friendly name for a storage pool, as shown here:

```powershell
Enable-ClusterStorageSpacesDirect -PoolFriendlyName "$ClusterName Storage Pool" -CimSession $ClusterName
```

To see the storage pools, use this:

```powershell
Get-StoragePool -CimSession $session
```

Congrats, you have now created a cluster.

## After you create the cluster

Now that you are done, there are still some important tasks you need to complete:

- Setup a cluster witness. See [Set up a cluster witness](../manage/witness.md).
- Create your volumes. See [Create volumes](../manage/create-volumes.md).
- For stretched clusters, create volumes and setup replication using Storage Replica. See [Create volumes and set up replication for stretched clusters](../manage/create-stretched-volumes.md).

## Next steps

- Register your cluster with Azure. See [Manage Azure registration](../manage/manage-azure-registration.md).
- Do a final validation of the cluster. See [Validate an Azure Stack HCI cluster](validate.md)
