# Create an Azure Stack HCI cluster using Windows Admin Center

> Applies to Azure Stack HCI, version v20H2

In this article you will learn how to use Windows Admin Center to create an Azure Stack HCI hyperconverged cluster that uses Storage Spaces Direct. The Create Cluster wizard in Windows Admin Center will do most of the heavy lifting for you. If you'd rather do it yourself with PowerShell, see [Create an Azure Stack HCI cluster using PowerShell](create-cluster-powershell.md).

You have a choice between creating two cluster types:

- Standard cluster with at least two server nodes, residing in a single site.
- Stretched cluster with at least four server nodes that span across two sites, with at least two nodes per site.

For more information about stretched clusters, see [Stretched clusters overview](../concepts/stretched-clusters.md).

## Before you run the wizard

Before you run the Create Cluster wizard, make sure you:

- Have read the hardware and other requirements in [Before you deploy Azure Stack HCI](before-you-start.md).
- Install the Azure Stack HCI OS on each server in the cluster. See [Deploy the Azure Stack HCI operating system](operating-system.md).
- Install Windows Admin Center on a remote (management) computer. See [Before you deploy Azure Stack HCI](before-you-start.md). Don't run the wizard from a server in the cluster.
- Have an account that’s a member of the local Administrators group on each server.

Also, your management computer must be joined to the same Active Directory domain in which you'll create the cluster, or a fully trusted domain. The servers that you'll cluster don't need to belong to the domain yet; they can be added to the domain during cluster creation.

Here are the major steps in the Create Cluster wizard:

1. **Get Started** - ensures that each server meets the prerequisites for and features needed for cluster join.
1. **Networking** - assigns and configures network adapters and creates the virtual switches for each server.
1. **Clustering** - validates the cluster is set up correctly. For stretched clusters, also sets up up the two sites.
1. **Storage** - Configures Storage Spaces Direct.

After the wizard completes, you set up the cluster witness, register with Azure, and create volumes (which also sets up replication between sites if you're creating a stretched cluster).

OK, lets begin:

1. In Windows Admin Center, under **All connections**, click **Add**.
1. In the **Add resources** panel, under **Windows Server cluster**, select **Create new**.
1. Under **Choose cluster type**, select **Azure Stack HCI**.
1. Under **Select server locations**, select one the following:

    - **All servers in one site**
    - **Servers in two sites** (for stretched cluster)

1. When finished, click **Create**. You will now see the Create Cluster wizard, as shown below.

## Step 1: Get started

Step 1 of the wizard walks you through making sure all prerequisites are met, adding the server nodes, installing needed features, and then restarting each server if needed.

1. Review the prerequisites listed in the wizard to ensure each server node is cluster-ready. When finished, click **Next**.
1. On **Add servers to the cluster** page, enter your account username and password, then click **Next**. This account must be a member of the local Administrators group on each server.
1. Enter the name of the first server you want to add, then click **Add**.
1. Repeat Step 3 for each server that will be part of the cluster. When finished, click **Next**.
1. If needed, on the **Join the servers to a domain​** page, specify the domain and an account to join the servers to the domain. Then optionally rename the servers to more friendly names and click **Next**.
1. Click **Install Features**. When finished, click **Next**.

    The wizard installs the following required features for you:

    - BitLocker
    - Data Center Bridging (for RoCEv2 network adapters)
    - Failover Clustering
    - File Server (for file-share witness or hosting file shares)
    - FS-Data-Deduplication module
    - Hyper-V
    - RSAT-AD-PowerShell module
    - Storage Replica (only installed for stretched clusters)

1. For **Install updates**, if required, click **Install updates**. When complete, click **Next**.
1. For **Solution updates**, if required, click **Install extension**. When complete, click **Next**.
1. Click **Restart servers**, if required. Verify that each server has successfully started.

## Step 2: Networking

Step 2 of the wizard walks you through verifying network interface adapters (NICs), selecting a management adapter, assigning IP addresses, subnet masks, and VLAN IDs for each server and creating the virtual switches.

It is mandatory to select at least one of the adapters for management purposes, as the wizard requires at least one dedicated physical NIC for cluster management.  Once an adapter is designated for management, it’s excluded from the rest of the wizard workflow.

Management adapters have two configuration options:

- Physical adapter - if the selected adapter uses DHCP addressing, it is used.

- Teamed adapters (for virtual switch creation) - if the selected adapters use DHCP addressing (either for one or both), the DHCP IP address would be assigned as static IP addresses for these adapters.

By using teamed adapters, you have a single connection to multiple physical switches but only use a single IP address. Load-balancing becomes available and fault-tolerance is instant instead of waiting for DNS records to update.

Let's begin:

1. Select **Next: Networking**.
1. Under **Verify the network adapters**, wait until green checkboxes appear next to each adapter, then select **Next**.

1. For **Select management adapters**, select one or two management adapters to use for each server and then do the following for each server:

    - Select the **Description** checkbox. Note that all adapters are selected and that the wizard may offer a recommendation for you.
    - Unselect the checkboxes for those adapters you don't want used for cluster management.

     You can use 1 Gb adapters as management adapters, but we recommend using 10 Gb or faster adapters for carrying storage and workload (VM) traffic.

1. When changes have been made, click **Apply and test**.
1. Under **Define networks**, make sure each network adapter for each server has a unique static IP address, a subnet mask, and a VLAN ID. Hover over each table element and enter or change values as needed. When finished, click **Apply and test**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Network adapters that don’t support the `VLANID` advanced property won’t accept VLAN IDs.

1. Wait until the **Status** column shows **Passed** for each server, then click **Next**. This step verifies network connectivity between all adapters with the same subnet and VLAN ID. The provided IP addresses are transferred from the physical adapter to the virtual adapters once the virtual switches are created in the next step. It may take several minutes to complete depending on the number of adapters configured.

1. Under **Virtual switch**, select one of the following options as applicable. Depending on how many adapters are present, not all options may show up.

    - Create one virtual switch for both Hyper-V and storage use
    - Create one virtual switch for Hyper-V use only
    - Create two virtual switches, one for Hyper-V and one for storage use
    - Don't create a virtual switch

1. Change the name of a switch and other configuration settings as needed, then click **Apply and test**. The **Status** column should show **Passed** for each server after the virtual switches have been created.

## Step 3: Clustering

Step 3 of the wizard makes sure everything thus far has been set up correctly, assigns sites in the case of stretched cluster deployments, and then actually creates the cluster.

1. Select **Next: Clustering**.
1. Under **Validate the cluster**, select **Validate**. Validation may take several minutes.

    If the **Credential Security Service Provider (CredSSP)** pop-up appears, select **Yes** to temporarily enable CredSSP for the wizard to continue. Once your cluster is created and the wizard has completed, you'll disable CredSSP to increase security.

1. Review all validation statuses, download the report to get detailed information on any failures, make changes, then click **Validate again** as needed. Repeat again as necessary until all validation checks pass.
1. Under **Create the cluster**, enter a name for your cluster.
1. Under **Networks**, select the preferred configuration.
1. Under **IP addresses**, select either dynamic or static IP addresses to use.
1. When finished, click **Create cluster**.

1. For stretched clusters, Under **Assign servers to sites**, name the two sites that will be used.

1. Next assign each server to a site. You'll set up replication across sites later. When finished, click **Apply**.

## Step 4: Storage

Step 4 of the wizard walks you through setting up Storage Spaces Direct for your cluster.


1. Select **Next: Storage**.
1. Under **Verify drives**, click the **>** icon next to each server to verify that the disks are working and connected, then click **Next**.
1. Under **Clean drives**, click **Clean drives** to empty the drives of data. When ready, click **Next**.
1. Under **Validate storage**, click **Next**.
1. Review the validation results. If all is good, click **Next**.
1. Under **Enable Storage Spaces Direct**, click **Enable**.
1. Download the report and review. When all is good, click **Finish**.

Congratulations, you now have a cluster.

After the cluster is created, it can take time for the cluster name to be replicated across your domain. If resolving the cluster isn't successful after some time, in most cases you can substitute the computer name of a server node in the the cluster instead of the cluster name.

## After you run the wizard

After the wizard has completed, there are still some important tasks you need to complete in order to have a fully-functioning cluster.

The first task is to disable the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) protocol on each server for security purposes. Remember that CredSSP needed to be enabled for the wizard. For more information, see [CVE-2018-0886](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-0886).

1. In Windows Admin Center, under **All connections**, select the cluster you just created.
1. Under **Tools**, select **Servers**.
1. In the right pane, select the first server in the cluster.
1. Under **Overview**, select **Disable CredSSP**. You will see that the red **CredSSP ENABLED** banner at the top disappears.
1. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each server in your cluster.

OK, now here are the other tasks you will need to do:

- Setup a cluster witness. See [Set up a cluster witness](witness.md).
- Create your volumes. See [Create volumes](../manage/create-volumes.md).
- For stretched clusters, create volumes and setup replication using Storage Replica. See [Create volumes and set up replication for stretched clusters](../manage/create-stretched-volumes.md).

## Next steps

- Register your cluster with Azure. See [Manage Azure registration](../manage/manage-azure-registration.md).
- Do a final validation of the cluster. See [Validate an Azure Stack HCI cluster](validate.md)
- Provision your VMs. See [Manage VMs on Azure Stack HCI using Windows Admin Center](../manage/vm.md).
- You can also create a cluster using PowerShell. See [Create an Azure Stack HCI cluster using PowerShell](create-cluster-powershell.md).
