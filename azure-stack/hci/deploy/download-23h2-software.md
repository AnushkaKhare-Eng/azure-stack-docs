# Download operating system for Azure Local deployment

[!INCLUDE [hci-applies-to-23h2](../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes how to download the operating system (OS) software from the Azure portal to deploy an Azure Local instance.

The first step in deploying Azure Local, version 23H2 is to download the software from the Azure portal. The software download includes a free 60-day trial. However, if you've purchased Integrated System solution hardware from the [Azure Local Catalog](https://aka.ms/AzureStackHCICatalog) through your preferred Microsoft hardware partner, the OS should be preinstalled. In that case, you can skip this step and move on to [Register your machines and assign permissions for Azure Local deployment](./deployment-arc-register-server-permissions.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the download of the software from Azure portal, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- An Azure account. If you donâ€™t already have an Azure account, first [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- An Azure subscription. You can use an existing subscription of any type:

   - Free account with Azure credits [for students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/) or [Visual Studio subscribers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/).
   - [Pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/) subscription with credit card.
   - Subscription obtained through an Enterprise Agreement (EA).
   - Subscription obtained through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program.
