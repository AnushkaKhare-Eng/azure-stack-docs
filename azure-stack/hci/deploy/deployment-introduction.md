# Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 deployment overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article is the first in the series of deployment articles that describe how to deploy Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2.

[!INCLUDE [important](../../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## About deployment methods

You can deploy Azure Stack HCI using one of the following methods from Azure portal:

- **New configuration**: Select this option if this is the first time you deploy an Azure Stack HCI cluster using Azure portal and you donâ€™t have an existing template. Going through the deployment flow steps, you define all the parameters manually.

- **Template spec**: Select this option if you will deploy your Azure Stack HCI system using a template in the QuickStart library. Once the template is loaded, the parameters are automatically populated with the template values. You are required to create a new Azure Storage Account to store the cloud witness secrets.

- **QuickStart template**: Select this option if you already deployed an Azure Stack HCI cluster and you stored a template in the QuickStart library. Once the template is loaded, the parameters are automatically populated. You are required to create a new Azure Storage Account to store the Cloud Witness Secrets.


## Deployment sequence

Follow this process sequence to deploy Azure Stack HCI in your environment:

- Select one of the [validated network topologies](#validated-network-topologies) to deploy.
- Read the [prerequisites](../index.yml) for Azure Stack HCI.
- Follow the [deployment checklist](deployment-checklist.md).
- Prepare your [Active Directory](deployment-prep-active-directory.md) environment.
- [Azure Stack HCI OS](deployment-install-os.md) on each server.
- Deploy using one of the three deployment methods described previously.
- After deployment, [validate deployment](../index.yml).
- If needed, [troubleshoot deployment](../index.yml).

## Validated network topologies

When deploying Azure Stack HCI Cluster from Azure Portal, the network configuration options will vary depending on the number of servers and the type of storage connectivity. Azure portal guides you through the supported options for each configuration. 

Before starting the network configuration for your cluster, we recommend you check the following table showing the supported and available options.

|Topology|Azure portal|Azure Resource Manager template|
|---|---|---|
|1 node - no switch for storage|By default|Supported|
1 node - with network switch for storage|Not applicable|Supported|
2 nodes - no switch for storage|Supported|Supported|
2 nodes - with network switch for storage|Supported|Supported|
3 nodes - with network switch for storage|Supported|Supported|
4 to 16 nodes - with network switch for storage|Supported|Supported|

**No switch for storage**. When selecting this option, your Azure Stack HCI system uses crossover network cables directly connected to your network interfaces for storage communication. The current supported switchless deployments from the portal are one or two nodes.

**Network switch for storage**. When selecting this option, your Azure Stack HCI system uses network switches connected to your network interfaces for storage communication. You can deploy up to 16 nodes using this configuration.

You next select the [network reference pattern](../plan/choose-network-pattern.md).
