# Configure firewalls for Azure Stack HCI

>Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2

This topic provides guidance on how to configure firewalls for the Azure Stack HCI operating system. It includes connectivity requirements, and explains how service tags group IP addresses in Azure that the operating system needs to access. The topic also provides steps to update Microsoft Defender Firewall.

## Connectivity requirements
Azure Stack HCI needs to periodically connect to Azure. Access is limited to only:
- Well-known Azure IPs
- Outbound direction
- Port 443 (HTTPS)

For more information, see the "Azure Stack HCI connectivity" section of the [Azure Stack HCI FAQ](../faq.md)

This topic describes how to optionally use a highly locked-down firewall configuration to block all traffic to all destinations except those included on your allow list.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   > If outbound connectivity is restricted by your external corporate firewall or proxy server, ensure that the URLs listed in the table below are not blocked. For related information, see the "Networking configuration" section of [Overview of Azure Arc enabled servers agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/agent-overview#networking-configuration).


As shown below, Azure Stack HCI accesses Azure using more than one firewall potentially.

## Working with service tags
A *service tag* represents a group of IP addresses from a given Azure service. Microsoft manages the IP addresses included in the service tag, and automatically updates the service tag as IP addresses change to keep updates to a minimum. To learn more, see [Virtual network service tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview).

## Required endpoint daily access (after Azure registration)
Azure maintains well-known IP addresses for Azure services that are organized using service tags. Azure publishes a weekly JSON file of all the IP addresses for every service. The IP addresses don’t change often, but they do change a few times per year. The following table shows the service tag endpoints that the operating system needs to access.

| Description                   | Service tag for IP range  | URL                                                                                 |
| :-----------------------------| :-----------------------  | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Azure Active Directory        | AzureActiveDirectory      | `https://login.microsoftonline.com`<br> `https://graph.microsoft.com`               |
| Azure Resource Manager        | AzureResourceManager      | `https://management.azure.com`                        |
| Azure Stack HCI Cloud Service | AzureFrontDoor.Frontend   | `https://azurestackhci.azurefd.net` |
| Azure Arc                     | AzureArcInfrastructure<br> AzureTrafficManager | Depends on the functionality you want to use:<br> Hybrid Identity Service: `*.his.arc.azure.com`<br> Guest Configuration: `*.guestconfiguration.azure.com`<br> **Note:** Expect more URLs as we enable more functionality. |

## Update Microsoft Defender Firewall
This section shows how to configure Microsoft Defender Firewall to allow IP addresses associated with a service tag to connect with the operating system:

1. Download the JSON file from the following resource to the target computer running the operating system: [Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags – Public Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519).

1. Use the following PowerShell command to open the JSON file:

    ```powershell
    $json = Get-Content -Path .\ServiceTags_Public_20201012.json | ConvertFrom-Json
    ```

1. Get the list of IP address ranges for a given service tag, such as the “AzureResourceManager” service tag:

    ```powershell
    $IpList = ($json.values | where Name -Eq "AzureResourceManager").properties.addressPrefixes
    ```

1. Import the list of IP addresses to your external corporate firewall, if you're using an allow list with it.

1. Create a firewall rule for each server in the cluster to allow outbound 443 (HTTPS) traffic to the list of IP address ranges:

    ```powershell
    New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow Azure Resource Manager" -RemoteAddress $IpList -Direction Outbound -LocalPort 443 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -Profile Any -Enabled True
    ```

## Additional endpoint for one-time Azure registration
During the Azure registration process, when you run either `Register-AzStackHCI` or use Windows Admin Center, the cmdlet tries to contact the PowerShell Gallery to verify that you have the latest version of required PowerShell modules, such as Az and AzureAD. Although the PowerShell Gallery is hosted on Azure, currently there isn't a service tag for it. If you can't run the `Register-AzStackHCI` cmdlet from a server node because of no internet access, we recommend downloading the modules to your management computer, and then manually transferring them to the server node where you want to run the cmdlet.
