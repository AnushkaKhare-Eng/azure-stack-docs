# Security baseline

This article describes the security baseline settings associated with your Azure Stack HCI. Azure Stack HCI is a secure-by-default product and has more than 200 security settings enabled right from the start. These settings provide a consistent security baseline and ensure that the device always starts in a known good state.

## Benefits of the security baseline

The security baseline on Azure Stack HCI:

- Enables customers to closely meet with CIS Benchmark and DISA STIG requirements for the OS and the Microsoft recommended security baseline.
- Reduces OPEX - with built-in drift protection, and consistent at scale monitoring via Azure Arc Hybrid edge baseline.
- Improves the security posture via disablement of legacy protocols and ciphers.
