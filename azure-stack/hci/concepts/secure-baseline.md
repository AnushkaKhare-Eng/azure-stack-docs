# Security baseline

Weâ€™re working diligently to provide a secure by default product to our customers. Part of this work is to provide a consistent security baseline from the cloud to the edge, on-premises. You may notice that over 200 security settings are now enabled by default right from the start. These settings ensure that the device always starts in a known good state. We'll continue to expand the list of default security settings over time.

This security baseline enables customers to closely meet with CIS Benchmark and DISA STIG requirements for the OS and the Microsoft recommended security baseline. It reduces OPEX - with built-in drift protection, and consistent at scale monitoring via Azure Arc Hybrid edge baseline. Finally, it also improves the security posture via disablement of legacy protocols and ciphers.
