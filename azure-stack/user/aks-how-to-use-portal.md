# Using Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack Hub in the portal

You can use the Azure Stack Hub user portal in the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) blade to discover, create, scale, upgrade, and delete AKS clusters.

## Discover available AKS clusters

1.  In the Azure Stack tenant portal find the "All Services" blade and select "Kubernetes services"

1.  Verify that all clusters that you have created appear in the "Kubernetes service" blade:

1.  Verify that you can view the details of any of the clusters:

## Delete cluster

1.  In the overview blade for the AKS cluster, find and select **Delete** as in the image below.

    ![You can review the details of your cluster in the portal.](media/aks-how-to-use/delete-cluster.png)

2.  Verify the cluster is deleted. Also, check that the associated resource group is deleted, in the Resource groups blade, look for a resource group with this pattern `<â€¦>_clustername_location`, if it is not found it was properly deleted.
