# Connect an IoT Edge device to IoT Hub on Azure Stack Hub

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](../includes/iot-hub-preview.md)]

This article shows you how to connect a virtual IoT Edge device to IoT Hub running on Azure Stack Hub. You can use the same general process to connect a physical device to your IoT Hub.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following prerequisites before continuing:

- You'll need an account that can access the [Azure Stack Hub user portal](../user/azure-stack-use-portal.md), with at least ["contributor" permissions](../user/azure-stack-manage-permissions.md).

- Work with your administrator to [install the IoT Hub on Azure Stack Hub resource provider](../operator/iot-hub-rp-overview.md). The installation steps also cover the creation of an offer that includes the IoT Hub service. 

- Once an offer is available, your administrator can create or update your Azure Stack Hub subscription to include IoT Hub. Alternatively, you can [subscribe to the new offer and create your own subscription](azure-stack-subscribe-services.md).

- It's helpful to have a basic understanding of Public Key Encryption (PKI). Specifically, how a Certificate Authority (CA) and X509 certificates are used to build a chain of trust. This trust allows network nodes to securely authenticate and communicate with each other, such as your IoT Hub service and IoT Edge device. 

## Overview

Here's a summary of the steps you'll complete, to connect an IoT Edge device to your IoT Hub on Azure Stack Hub:

1. Create IoT Hub and Linux VM resources on your Azure Stack Hub instance. The Linux VM will serve as a virtual IoT Edge device. 
2. Configure the certificates required for the IoT Edge device. The number of steps required will depend on the type of CA that issued your IoT Hub root CA certificate.
3. Configure the software and services required for the IoT Edge device.
4. Test the IoT Edge device to make sure it's working properly and communicating with your IoT Hub.

Before running the script in each section, be sure to update the script placeholders to match your environment's configuration. Make note of the values you use, as you'll need them in later sections:

| Placeholder | Example | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `<DEVICE-CA-CERT-NAME>` | `edged1cert`| The name you give the IoT Edge device CA certificate. |
| `<IOT-HUB-HOSTNAME>`| `test-hub-1.mgmtiothub.region.mydomain.com`| Your IoT Hub host name. |
| `<IOT-HUB-ROOT-CA>`| `root.cer`| The filename you give to the exported IoT Hub root CA (if using a private CA). |
| `<DATA-DIR>`| `/home/edgeadmin/edged1`| The full path to the data directory you create on the Linux VM. |
| `<USER-ACCOUNT>`| `edgeadmin`| The account you use to sign in to the Linux VM. |

## Create Azure Stack Hub resources

First you create the necessary Azure Stack Hub resources, including an IoT Hub and a Linux VM. You'll use the [Azure Stack Hub user portal](../user/azure-stack-use-portal.md) to create these resources.

### Create an IoT Hub resource

1. Sign in to the [Azure Stack Hub user portal](../user/azure-stack-use-portal.md) from a computer that has access to your Azure Stack Hub instance.
2. If you haven't created one already, follow the instructions in the [Create an IoT Hub](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal#create-an-iot-hub) section of **Create an IoT hub using the Azure portal**, to create an IoT Hub resource. 

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Be sure to use the [Azure Stack Hub user portal](../user/azure-stack-use-portal.md) when following the steps in the article, and NOT the Azure portal. Also note that some screenshots and instructions may be slightly different, as not all Azure features are available on Azure Stack Hub. 

### Deploy and configure a Linux VM 

In this section, you deploy a new Linux VM, which will serve as the virtual IoT Edge device:

1. Using the [Create a Linux server VM by using the Azure Stack Hub portal](azure-stack-quick-linux-portal.md) quick start, install a Linux VM on your Azure Stack Hub instance. Be sure to enable port **SSH (22)** on the **Select public inbound ports** property, when you get to the **Settings** page. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > You only need to complete the first 5 sections, up through **Connect to the VM**, as you won't need the NGINX web server. 

2. After you've created and connected to the VM using PuTTY, create a data subdirectory off of your user account home directory, for example:

   ```bash
   mkdir edged1
   ```

3. Set up the certificate generation tool using one of the following methods. Either will download files from the IoT Edge GitHub repository, required later for generating device certificates:

   **Use cURL script:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the edge device data directory
   cd <DATA-DIR>
   
   # Download certGen.sh script file, and openssl_root_ca.cnf config file
   curl -Lo certGen.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/iotedge/master/tools/CACertificates/certGen.sh
   curl -Lo openssl_root_ca.cnf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/iotedge/master/tools/CACertificates/openssl_root_ca.cnf
   ```
   **Use Git to clone the repository:**
   
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the home directory
   cd /home/<USER-ACCOUNT>
   
   # Clone the iotedge repo, which contains the certGen.sh script file and openssl_root_ca.cnf config file
   git clone https://github.com/Azure/iotedge.git
   
   # Navigate to the edge device data directory
   cd <DATA-DIR>
   
   # Copy certGen.sh and openssl_root_ca.cnf into your working directory
   cp /home/<USER-ACCOUNT>/iotedge/tools/CACertificates/*.cnf .
   cp /home/<USER-ACCOUNT>/iotedge/tools/CACertificates/certGen.sh .
   ```

## Configure IoT Edge device certificates

In this section, you'll complete the VM certificate configuration required by the virtual IoT Edge device. 

Your IoT Hub service and the IoT Edge device are secured with X509 certificates. Both must use a root CA certificate issued by the same CA. Select the appropriate tab below to complete certificate configuration, based on the root CA type being used by your IoT Hub.

# [Public CA](#tab/public-ca)

[!INCLUDE [common-cert-config](../includes/iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device-cert-common.md)]

# [Private CA](#tab/private-ca)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using a private CA, additional steps are required to transfer the IoT Hub root CA certificate to the IoT Edge device. Complete these steps ***only*** if you're using your own private CA for certificate generation. If your IoT Hub root CA certificate was issued by a public CA, select the preceding **Public CA** tab. 

### Export the root CA certificate from your IoT Hub

Using a machine with access to your Azure Stack Hub, export the IoT Hub root CA certificate in PEM format. The following example shows how to export the certificate using either a [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) browser: 

   1. On the **Overview** page of your IoT Hub, use the **Copy** button to the right of the **Hostname** property to copy the IoT Hub hostname to the clipboard:  

      [![IoT Hub host name](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\copy-iot-hub-host-name.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\copy-iot-hub-host-name.png#lightbox)
   1. Open a new tab in a Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome browser, enter `https://`, paste the IoT Hub hostname copied in the previous step, and press **Enter**. 

   1. After the error message is returned, select the lock icon to the left of the address bar, then select **Certificate**.
      [![certificate secure connection](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-hub-root-ca-connection.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-hub-root-ca-connection.png#lightbox)

   1. When the SSL/TLS certificate shows, select the **Certification path** tab. Then select the top-most certificate in the path, and select the **View Certificate** button.  
      [![certificate secure connection for SSL cert](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-hub-root-ca-certificate-ssl.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-hub-root-ca-certificate-ssl.png#lightbox) 

   1. When the root CA certificate shows, select the **Details** tab, then the **Copy to File...** button.
      [![certificate secure connection for root CA cert](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-hub-root-ca-certificate-ssl-root-ca.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-hub-root-ca-certificate-ssl-root-ca.png#lightbox) 

   1. When the **Certificate Export Wizard** shows, export the certificate to a **Base-64 encoded X.509 format** file, for example, **root.cer**. You use this file in the next section, so export it to a location that can be accessed from, or copied to, the Linux VM.

   1. After the export finishes successfully, you can close the browser tab.

### Install the IoT Hub root CA certificate on the IoT Edge device

Now install the IoT Hub root CA certificate you exported in the previous section, into the IoT Edge device's trusted store. 

1. Transfer the IoT Hub root CA file you exported in the previous section, to the IoT Edge device. Since we're using a Linux VM as the IoT Edge device, you'll need to copy it to the Linux VM. Depending on your environment, consider using either PuTTY with the PSCP command, or the WinSCP program to copy the file to the Linux VM.
2. Run the following script from your Linux VM PuTTY session, where you've stored the IoT Hub root CA file. The script will verify that the TLS connection is successful, and install the root CA in the IoT Edge device's trusted store:

   ```bash
   # Verify connection failed first
   # Expected response: Verify return code: 2 (unable to get issuer certificate)
   openssl s_client -connect <IOT-HUB-HOSTNAME>:443
   
   # Verify connection succeeded when root CA provided
   # Expected response: Verify return code: 0 (ok)
   openssl s_client -connect <IOT-HUB-HOSTNAME>:443 -CAfile <IOT-HUB-ROOT-CA>
   
   # Install root CA in the trusted store on Edge device
   sudo cp <IOT-HUB-ROOT-CA> /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
   sudo update-ca-certificates
   
   # Verify connection succeeded even when no root CA provided
   # Expected response: Verify return code: 0 (ok)
   openssl s_client -connect <IOT-HUB-HOSTNAME>:443
   ```

[!INCLUDE [common-cert-config](../includes/iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device-cert-common.md)]

### Append the IoT Hub root CA to the device root CA

Now append the IoT Hub root CA you exported and copied to the IoT Edge device, to the device root CA you generated earlier:

```bash
# Navigate to home directory
cd /home/<USER-ACCOUNT>

# Append IoT Hub root CA to the device root CA
cat <IOT-HUB-ROOT-CA> >> certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem
```
-----

## Configure IoT Edge device software and services

In this section, you'll complete the IoT Hub and VM configuration required by the virtual IoT Edge device.

### Install IoT Edge and container runtimes on the VM

1. Return to the VM PuTTY session and run the following script to register the Microsoft key and software repository feed:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the home directory
   cd /home/<USER-ACCOUNT>

   # Install the repository configuration. 
   curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/multiarch/prod.list > ./microsoft-prod.list
   
   # Copy the generated list.
   sudo cp ./microsoft-prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
   
   # Install Microsoft GPG public key.
   curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
   sudo cp ./microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
   ```

2. Install the container runtime:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install moby-engine moby-cli
   ```

3. Install the Azure IoT Edge security daemon:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install iotedge
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> You can ignore the **IMPORTANT: Please update the configuration file** notice for now, as you'll update it in a later section.

### Create an IoT Edge device in IoT Hub

1. Return to the [Azure Stack Hub user portal](../user/azure-stack-use-portal.md), and navigate to the **IoT Hub** service.

2. Select your IoT Hub resource, then select the **IoT Edge** page, then **Add an IoT Edge device**.

   [![IoT Hub resource](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\add-an-iot-edge-device.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\add-an-iot-edge-device.png#lightbox)

3. On the **Create a device** page, enter the **Device ID**, for example "edged1".
4. When finished, select **Save**.

   [![IoT Edge - create a device](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\create-iot-edge-device.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\create-iot-edge-device.png#lightbox)

5. When the portal returns to the **IoT Edge** page, select your new device from the devices list.

   [![IoT Edge - view devices](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\view-iot-edge-devices.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\view-iot-edge-devices.png#lightbox)

6. On the device details page, use the **Copy** button at the right of **Primary Connection String** to copy the string to the clipboard. You'll use the connection string in the next section.

   [![IoT Edge - device details](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-edge-device-details.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-edge-device-details.png#lightbox)

### Configure the virtual IoT Edge device on the VM

1. Return to the VM PuTTY session. Using Bash, open the configuration file in Nano on the virtual IoT Edge device:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/iotedge/config.yaml
   ```

2. Locate the `provisioning` property under comment **# Manual provisioning configuration using a connection string**, in the **Provisioning mode and settings** section. Update the IoT Edge device connection string, by replacing the `<ADD DEVICE CONNECTION STRING HERE>` placeholder with the connection string you copied to the clipboard in the previous section:

   > [!NOTE]
   > To paste clipboard contents into Nano, press and hold the **Shift** key and click the right mouse button. Or, press the **Shift** and **Insert** keys simultaneously. If the paste operation shifts your cursor to the rightmost end of the connection string, hit the **Home** key to return to the leftmost end.

   ```yaml
   # Manual provisioning configuration using a connection string
   provisioning:
     source: "manual"
     device_connection_string: "<ADD DEVICE CONNECTION STRING HERE>"
   ```

3. Locate and uncomment the `certificates` property in the **Certificate settings** section. Uncomment and replace the file URIs with the paths to the three certificates you created earlier, for example:

   ```yaml
   certificates:
     device_ca_cert: "<DATA-DIR>/certs/iot-edge-device-ca-<DEVICE-CA-CERT-NAME>-full-chain.cert.pem"
     device_ca_pk: "<DATA-DIR>/private/iot-edge-device-ca-<DEVICE-CA-CERT-NAME>.key.pem"
     trusted_ca_certs: "<DATA-DIR>/certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem"
   ```

4. When completed, the `provisioning` and `certificates` properties should look similar to the following responses:

   [![Nano editor - provisioning property](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\nano-edit-config-yml-connection-string.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\nano-edit-config-yml-connection-string.png#lightbox)

   [![Nano editor - certificates property](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\nano-edit-config-yml-certificates.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\nano-edit-config-yml-certificates.png#lightbox)


5. Save and close the file using **CTRL** + **X**, then **Y**, then **Enter**.

6. After you return to Bash, restart the daemon:
   
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart iotedge
   ```

## Verify a successful installation

1. Check the status of the IoT Edge daemon:

   ```bash
   systemctl status iotedge
   ```

2. You should see that the IoT Edge service is running and "active", with a response similar to the following. If so, you can jump ahead to step #4.

   [![IoT Edge service running successfully](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-edge-service-running.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-edge-service-running.png#lightbox)

3. If the IoT Edge service failed:
   - You'll see a response similar showing "failed", similar to the following example:
   [![IoT Edge service failed](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-edge-service-failed.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-edge-service-failed.png#lightbox)   
   - To troubleshoot, you can:
     - Examine the daemon logs:

         ```bash
         journalctl -u iotedge --no-pager --no-full
         ```
     - Run the troubleshooting tool to check for the most common configuration and networking errors. In this example, a malformed `/etc/iotedge/config.yaml` file is detected:

         ```bash
         sudo iotedge check
         ```

         [![IoT Edge service check](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-edge-service-check.png)](media\iot-hub-connect-an-iot-edge-device\iot-edge-service-check.png#lightbox)

         > [!NOTE]
         > The `$edgeHub` system module is optional, and isn't deployed to the device until you deploy your first IoT Edge module. As such, `iotedge check` may return an error indicating that `$edgeHub` cannot bind to ports during a host connectivity check. This error can be ignored if `$edgeHub` is not required in your deployment.           

   - If you find that you have a malformed .YML file as in the example above, simply:
      - Repeat the steps in [Configure the virtual IoT Edge device on the VM](#configure-the-virtual-iot-edge-device-on-the-vm) to fix the .YML file.
      - Repeat the steps in [Verify a successful installation](#verify-a-successful-installation).

4. Once you determine that the IoT Edge service started successfully, list the running modules. You should see the service `edgeAgent` with a status of `running`:

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge list
   ```

## Clean up resources

If you'll no longer be using them, return to the [Azure Stack Hub user portal](../user/azure-stack-use-portal.md) and delete the VM and IoT Hub resources you created earlier.
