> [!NOTE]
> AD FS only supports interactive authentication with user identities. If a credential object is required, you must use a service principal (SPN). For more information about setting up a service principal with Azure Stack Hub and AD FS as your identity management service, see [Manage an AD FS app identity](../operator/give-app-access-to-resources.md#manage-an-azure-ad-app).
