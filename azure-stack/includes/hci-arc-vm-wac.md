> [!NOTE]
> The recommended way to create and manage VMs on Azure Stack HCI 23H2 is using the [Azure Arc control plane](../hci/manage/azure-arc-vm-management-overview.md). However, since the functionality described in this article is not yet provided by Azure Arc, you can use Windows Admin Center or PowerShell as described below.
> Using Windows Admin Center or PowerShell to create VMs on Azure Stack HCI 23H2 will not create Azure Stack HCI Arc enabled VMs. This comes at cost of no managability from Azure Arc Control plane, and limited features and fewer Azure Hybrid Benefits, such as no free use of Azure Update Manager for this VM.
