For Azure CLI, you can use two different modules based on the operating system version of your Azure Stack HCI cluster. If running:

 - Azure Stack HCI version 23H2, use the [stack-hci-vm module](../index.yml). This module is automatically installed on your Azure Stack HCI cluster during the deployment.
 - Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2, use the [azurestackhci module](/cli/azure/azurestackhci?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true).

You can also use the Azure portal to manage Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 systems. For an Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 system, the experience is degraded and you won't be able to manage your system via the portal.
