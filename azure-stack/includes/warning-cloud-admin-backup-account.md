> [!WARNING]  
> By default, your Azure Stack Hub stamp is configured with only one CloudAdmin account. There are no recovery options if the account credentials are lost, compromised, or locked. You will lose access to the privileged endpoint and other resources.
>
> It's highly recommended that you [create additional CloudAdmin accounts](../reference/pep/new-cloudadminuser.md), to avoid redeployment of your stamp at your own expense. Make sure you document these credentials based on your company's guidelines.
