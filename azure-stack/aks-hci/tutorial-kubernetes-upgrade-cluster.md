# Tutorial: Upgrade Kubernetes in Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI

As part of the application and cluster lifecycle, you may wish to upgrade to the latest available version of Kubernetes.

In this tutorial, part seven of seven, a Kubernetes cluster is upgraded. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Identify current and available Kubernetes versions
> * Upgrade the Kubernetes nodes
> * Validate a successful upgrade

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, an application was packaged into a container image. This image was uploaded to Azure Container Registry, and you created an AKS cluster. The application was then deployed to the AKS on Azure Stack HCI cluster. If you have not done these steps, and would like to follow along, start with [Tutorial 1 â€“ Create container images](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-application.md).

## Get available cluster versions

Before you upgrade a cluster, use the [Get-AksHciClusterUpgrades](get-akshciclusterupdates.md) command to check which Kubernetes releases are available for upgrade. If you followed [Tutorial 3 - Create Kubernetes Cluster](tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster.md), your cluster is up to date with the latest default version. For this example, the cluster called *mycluster* is running on version *v1.16.14*.

```powershell
Get-AksHciClusterUpgrades -name mycluster
```

In the following example, the current version is *v1.16.14*, and the available versions are shown under *kubernetesVersion*.

```Output
details                                                     kubernetesversion operatingsystemversion
-------                                                     ----------------- ----------------------
This is a patch kubernetes upgrade. (i.e v1.1.X  to v1.1.Y) v1.16.15-kvapkg.2 @{mariner=February 2021; windows=Febru...
This is a minor kubernetes upgrade. (i.e v1.X.1 to v1.Y.1)  v1.17.16          @{mariner=February 2021; windows=Febru...
```

You can list available Kubernetes versions by running the [Get-AksHciKubernetesVersion](get-akshcikubernetesversion.md).

```powershell
Get-AksHciKubernetesVersion
```

```Output
OS      Versions
--      --------
Linux   {v1.16.14, v1.16.15, v1.17.13, v1.17.16...}
Windows {v1.18.10, v1.18.14}
```

In the output above, you can see that there are more upgrade versions available. However, when upgrading clusters, you cannot skip versions. (i.e. v1.16.xx --> v1.17.xx is allowed, but v1.16.xx --> v1.18.xx is not. To upgrade from v1.16.xx to v1.18.xx, the upgrades must go in this order: v1.16.xx --> v1.17.xx --> v1.18.xx)

## Upgrade a cluster

Use the [Update-AksHciCluster](update-akshcicluster.md) command to upgrade the cluster.

```powershell
Update-AksHciCluster -name mycluster -kubernetesVersion v1.17.16
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can only upgrade one minor version at a time. For example, you can upgrade from *v1.16.xx* to *v1.17.xx*, but cannot upgrade from *v1.16.x* to *v1.18.xx* directly. To upgrade from *v1.16.xx* to *v1.18.xx*, first upgrade from *v1.16.xx* to *v1.17.xx*, then perform another upgrade from *v1.17.xx* to *v1.18.xx*.

## Validate an upgrade

Confirm that the upgrade was successful using the [Get-AksHciCluster](get-akshcicluster.md) command as follows:

```powershell
Get-AksHciCluster -name mycluster
```

The following example output shows the cluster runs *KubernetesVersion v1.17.16*:

```Output
Name            : mycluster
Version         : v1.17.16
Control Planes  : 1
Linux Workers   : 1
Windows Workers : 0
Phase           : provisioned
Ready           : True
```

## Delete the cluster

As this tutorial is the last part of the series, you may want to delete the cluster.  Use the [Remove-AksHciCluster](remove-akshcicluster.md) command to remove the resource group, container service, and all related resources.

```powershell
Remove-AksHciCluster -name mycluster
```

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you upgraded Kubernetes in an AKS on Azure Stack HCI cluster. You learned how to:
