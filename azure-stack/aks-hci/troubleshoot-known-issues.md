# Resolve known issues

This article includes workaround steps for resolving known issues that occur when using Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI.

## _Install-AksHci_ timed out with an error

After running `Install-AksHci`, the installation stopped and displayed a **waiting for API server** error message:

```output
\kubectl.exe --kubeconfig=C:\AksHci\0.9.7.3\kubeconfig-clustergroup-management get akshciclusters -o json returned a non zero exit code 1 [Unable to connect to the server: dial tcp 192.168.0.150:6443: connectex: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.]
```

There are multiple reasons why an installation might fail with the **waiting for API server** error. See the following sections for possible causes and solutions for this error.

### Incorrect DNS server

If youâ€™re using static IP, confirm that the DNS server is correctly configured. To check the host's DNS server address, use the following command:

```powershell
Get-NetIPConfiguration.DNSServer | ?{ $_.AddressFamily -ne 23} ).ServerAddresses
```

Confirm that the DNS server address is the same as the address used when running `New-AksHciNetworkSetting` by running the following command:

```powershell
Get-MocConfig
```

If the DNS server has been incorrectly configured, reinstall AKS on Azure Stack HCI with the correct DNS server. For more information, see [Restart, remove, or reinstall Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI ](./restart-cluster.md).

The issue was resolved after deleting the configuration and restarting the VM with a new configuration.

## Container storage interface pod stuck in a _ContainerCreating_ state

A new Kubernetes workload cluster was created with Kubernetes version 1.16.10, and then updated to 1.16.15. After the update, the `csi-msk8scsi-node-9x47m` pod was stuck in the _ContainerCreating_ state, and the `kube-proxy-qqnkr` pod was stuck in the _Terminating_ state as shown in the output below:

```output
Error: kubectl.exe get nodes  
NAME              STATUS     ROLES    AGE     VERSION 
moc-lf22jcmu045   Ready      <none>   5h40m   v1.16.15 
moc-lqjzhhsuo42   Ready      <none>   5h38m   v1.16.15 
moc-lwan4ro72he   NotReady   master   5h44m   v1.16.15

\kubectl.exe get pods -A 

NAMESPACE     NAME                                            READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE 
    5h38m 
kube-system   csi-msk8scsi-node-9x47m                         0/3     ContainerCreating   0          5h44m 
kube-system   kube-proxy-qqnkr                                1/1     Terminating         0          5h44m  
```

Since _kubelet_ ended up in a bad state and can no longer talk to the API server, the only solution is to restart the _kubelet_ service. After restarting, the cluster goes into a _running_ state.
