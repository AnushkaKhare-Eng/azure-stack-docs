# Encrypt etcd secrets on AKS on Azure Stack HCI clusters

A secret in Kubernetes is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data, such as passwords and SSH keys. In the Kubernetes API server, secrets are stored in _etcd_, which is a highly available key values store used as the Kubernetes backing store for all cluster data. When you enable encryption of etcd secrets, you can [encrypt secret data at rest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/) and also automate the management and rotation of encryption keys. 

> [!NOTE]
> In this preview release, encryption of etcd secrets is available only for new workload clusters. 

## Enable encryption of etcd secrets

Use the `-enableSecretsEncryption` parameter of the [New-AksHciCluster](./new-akshcicluster.md) command to enable encryption of etcd secrets and automate encryption key rotation as shown below: 

```powershell
New-AksHciCluster -name mynewcluster -enableSecretsEncryption
```

Once you deploy a new cluster with the `-enableSecretsEncryption` parameter, you cannot disable this feature.

## Monitor and troubleshoot

To simplify application deployment on Kubernetes clusters, review the [documentation and scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/AKS-HCI-Apps) that are available.

- To set up logging using Elasticsearch, Fluent Bit and Kibana, follow the steps to [install the tools and set up logging](https://github.com/microsoft/AKS-HCI-Apps/tree/main/Logging)
- To use the monitoring tool Prometheus, follow the steps to [install Prometheus in a Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/microsoft/AKS-HCI-Apps/tree/main/Monitoring#certs-and-keys-monitoring)

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the logs on the control plane node under `/var/log/pods`.

## Next steps

In this how-to guide, you learned how to enable the encryption of etcd secrets for new workload clusters. Next, you can:

- [Deploy a Windows Server application on a Kubernetes cluster](./deploy-windows-application.md).
