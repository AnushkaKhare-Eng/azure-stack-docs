# Deploy a container image from Azure Container Registry to AKS on Azure Stack HCI

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have an understanding of how to deploy container images from Azure Container Registry (ACR) to AKS on Azure Stack HCI and create a private ACR. Azure Container Registry allows you to build, store, and manage container images and artifacts in a private registry for all types of container deployments. 

This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of [Kubernetes concepts](kubernetes-concepts.md). 

## Before you begin

Verify that you have the following installed:

- An AKS on Azure Stack HCI cluster that's up and running.
- [Install the Azure CLI ](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- Your local `kubectl` environment is configured to point to your AKS on Azure Stack HCI cluster. You can use the [Get-AksHciCredential](./get-akshcicredential.md) PowerShell command to configure your cluster for access using `kubectl`.

## Create an Azure Container Registry

To create an Azure Container Registry, you first need a resource group. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command. In the following example, a resource group in the *eastus* region is created:

```azurecli
az group create --name <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --location eastus
```

Create an Azure Container Registry instance with the [az acr create](/cli/azure/acr) command and provide your own registry name. The registry name must be unique within Azure and contain 5-50 alphanumeric characters. In the rest of this tutorial, `<acrName>` is used as a placeholder for the container registry name, and you'll provide your own unique registry name. The *Basic* SKU is a cost-optimized entry point for development purposes that provides a balance of storage and throughput.

```azurecli
az acr create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <REGISTRY_NAME> --sku Basic
```

Once your container registry has been created, use the following command to create a service principal, so you can access your container registry from Kubernetes: 

```azurecli
az ad sp create-for-rbac
  --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourcegroups/<RG_NAME>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<REGISTRY_NAME>
  --role Contributor
  --name <SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME>
```

Azure Container Registry supports three access roles, the **Contributor** role is the most common for application developers, however, in real world scenarios, you might need to create multiple service principals depending on the type of access needed:

- **Contributor**: This role offers push and pull access to the repository.
- **Reader**: This role only allows pull access to the repository.
- **Owner**: This role enables you to assign roles to other users, in addition to the push and pull access to the repository.

The above command should produce an output similar to the following:

```output
{
 "appId": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
 "displayName": "akshci-service-principal",
 "name": "http://akshci-service-principal",
 "password": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
 "tenant": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

Once the service principal has been successfully created, copy the `appId` and `password` in a safe location to use later in your deployment.

For more about working with service principals and Azure Container Registry, see [Azure Container Registry authentication with service principals](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal).

## Log in to the container registry

To use the Azure Container Registry instance, you must first log in. You can use either the Azure CLI or the Docker CLI to log in.

### Option 1: Log in from the Azure CLI

Use the [az acr login](/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-login) command and provide the unique name given to the container registry in the previous step.

```azurecli
az acr login --name <REGISTRY_NAME>
```

### Option 2: Log in from the Docker CLI

To use the Docker CLI to access your container registry, type the following command in a Bash or PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
docker login <REGISTRY_NAME>.azurecr.io -u <appId> -p <password>
```

In either option, the command should return a *Login Succeeded* message once completed.

## Push an image to Azure Container Registry

Once you are successfully logged in, you can start pushing the image to Azure Container Registry. First, let's run the `docker images` command to view the list of images on your local machine:

```output
REPOSITORY                               TAG                                      IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
mcr.microsoft.com/azure-functions/dotnet 3.0                                      9f8ad1bdee67   5 months ago    540MB
poemfinder-app                           latest                                   2d9bef425603   6 months ago    208MB
```

To get started, you will need to tag the image using the `docker tag` command, then use `docker push` to push it to Azure Container Registry. 

```powershell
docker tag poemfinder-app <REGISTRY_NAME>.azurecr.io/poemfinder-app:v1.0
```

Verify that the image has been correctly tagged by running the `docker images` command again. After confirming, run `docker push` to push to ACR as shown below:

```powershell
docker push <REGISTRY_NAME>.azurecr.io/poemfinder-app:v1.0
```

To confirm that the image was successfully pushed to Azure Container Registry, you can run the following command:

```powershell
az acr repository list --name <REGISTRY_NAME>.azurecr.io --output table
```

## Deploy an image from ACR to AKS on Azure Stack HCI

To deploy your container image from Azure Container Registry to your Kubernetes cluster, you need to create *Kubernetes Secrets* to store your registry credentials. Kubernetes uses an *image pull secret* to store information needed to authenticate to your registry. To create the pull secret for an Azure container registry, you provide the service principal ID, the password, and the registry URL.

```
kubectl create secret docker-registry <secret-name> \
    --namespace <namespace> \
    --docker-server=<REGISTRY_NAME>.azurecr.io \
    --docker-username=<appId> \
    --docker-password=<password>
```

where:

| Value             | Description                                                  |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `secret-name`     | Name of the image pull secret, for example, *acr-secret*     |
| `namespace`       | Kubernetes namespace to put the secret into Only needed if you want to place the secret in a namespace other than the default namespace |
| `<REGISTRY_NAME>` | Name of your Azure container registry, for example, *myregistry*  The `--docker-server` is the fully qualified name of the registry login server |
| `appId`           | ID of the service principal that will be used by Kubernetes to access your registry |
| `password`        | Service principal password                                   |

Once you've created the image pull secret, you can use it to create Kubernetes pods and deployments. Provide the name of the secret under `imagePullSecrets` in the deployment file as shown in the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: poemfinder-app
  namespace: mydemoapps
spec:
  containers:
    - name: poemfinder-app
      image: <REGISTRY_NAME>.azurecr.io/poemfinder-app:v1.0
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: acr-secret
```

In the preceding example, `poemfinder-app:v1.0` is the name of the image to pull from the Azure container registry, and `acr-secret` is the name of the pull secret you created to access the registry. When you deploy the pod, Kubernetes automatically pulls the image from your registry, if it is not already present on the cluster. 

You can save the above pod configuration in a file such as `pod-example.yaml`, and then deploy it to Kubernetes as shown below:

```powershell
kubectl create -f pod-example.yaml
```

To confirm that the pod was successfully created using the container image from Azure Container Registry, run `kubectl describe pod <POD_NAME>` which should show the container image used to create the pod.
