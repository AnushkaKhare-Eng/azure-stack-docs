# Container security

This article describes some of the methods you can use to implement security for containers. Containers are an effective means for packaging and deploying applications, and they provide operational and security benefits by allowing the decoupling of applications and services within a target environment. Containers also help to mitigate the effects of system-wide failures because of their abstraction, which ensures uptime and prevents attacks that could compromise applications or services. Containers typically run on an abstracted layer on top of the host operating system, and the abstraction offers some barrier of separation and the opportunity to apply a layered defense model. 

You can implement continuous container security by securing the container pipeline and the application, and by securing the container deployment environment. Some examples of implementing container security are described in this topic.

## Secure the images

Ensure that images are hosted on a secure and trusted registry to prevent unauthorized access. The images should have a TLS certificate with a trusted root CA and the registry should use Role Based Access Control (RBAC) with strong authentication. An image scanning solution should be included when designing CI/CD for the container build and delivery. This would help identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and ensure that exploitable images are not deployed without remediation.

## Hardening the host environment

An important aspect of container security is the need to harden the security of the systems that your containers are running on, and the way they act during runtime. Container security should focus on the entire stack, including your host as well as the daemons. Native services that are non-critical should be removed from the host and non-compliant containers should not be deployed in the environment. By doing this, access to the host would only be through the containers. Control would be centralized to the container daemon, removing the host from the attack surface. This becomes very helpful when proxy servers are used to access your containers, which could accidentally bypass your container security controls. 

## Limit container resources

When a container has been compromised, attackers may attempt to use the underlying host resources to perform malicious activities. It is good practice to set memory and CPU usage limits to minimize the impact of breaches.

## Properly secure secrets

Secrets are blobs of data containing sensitive information that may need to be passed between the host and the container. Some examples of secrets are passwords, SSL/TLS certificates, SSH private keys, tokens, connection strings, and other data that should not be transmitted in plain text or stored unencrypted. All secrets should be kept out of images and mounted through the container orchestration engine or external secret manager.

## Deploy runtime security monitoring

There is still a chance of getting compromised even after taking precautions against attacks on your infrastructure. Therefore, it is important to continuously monitor and log the applicationâ€™s behavior to prevent and detect malicious activities. Tools like Prometheus provide an effective means to monitor your infrastructure.
