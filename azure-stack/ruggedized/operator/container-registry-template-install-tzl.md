# Add a container registry to Azure Stack Hub (Ruggedized)

You can add the container registry to your Azure Stack Hub Marketplace so that your users can deploy and maintain their own container registry. This solution template installs and configures the open-source Docker Container Registry in a user subscription running on the AKS Base Ubuntu 16.04-LTS Image. The template supports both connected and disconnected (air-gapped) deployments and supports both Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Active Directory Federated Services (AD FS) deployed Azure Stack Hubs.

## Get the Marketplace item

You can find the **Container Registry Template** Marketplace item in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/msazurestackworkloads/azurestack-gallery/releases/download/registry-v1.0.2/Microsoft.AzureStackContainerRegistry.1.0.2.azpkg. The Marketplace item is available from the portal in select subscriptions.

You can also add the item (side load) to your Marketplace using the Microsoft.AzureStackDockerContainerRegistry.1.0.2.azpkg. The scripts in this article can be accessed by downloading the git repository as a (zip) package from https://github.com/msazurestackworkloads/azurestack-gallery/archive/master.zip, and extracting the files. You can find the script in the `azurestack-gallery-master\registry\scripts` folder.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have the following items before adding the Container Registry Marketplace item on Azure Stack Hub.

| Item | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Stack Hub PowerShell modules (Azs.Gallery.Admin) | PowerShell Modules | Only required if side loading the container registry template gallery item, the Azure Stack Hub PowerShell Modules are used to add and remove gallery items.<br>[Install Azure Stack PowerShell modules](../../operator/azure-stack-powershell-install.md) |
| Container Registry Template | Marketplace item | In order to deploy the container registry as an Azure Stack Hub user, the Container registry template Marketplace item must be available in your subscription, or manually added (side loaded), into your Azure Stack Hub Marketplace. If side loading, follow the instructions to side load the package in the `readme.md` in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/msazurestackworkloads/azurestack-gallery/releases/tag/registry-v1.0.1). |
| AKS Base Ubuntu 16.04-LTS Image, September 2019 minimum release version | Marketplace item | For your Azure Stack Hub users to deploy the container registry, you must make the AKS Base Image available in the Marketplace. The Container registry template uses the image when an Ubuntu VM that hosts the Docker container registry binaries. |
| Linux Custom Script Extension 2.0 | Marketplace item | For your Azure Stack Hub users to deploy the container registry, you must make the Linux Custom Script Extension available in the Marketplace. The Container registry template deployment uses the extension to configure the registry. |
| SSL Certificate | Certificate | Users deploying the Container registry template need to provide a PFX certificate used when configuring SSL encryption for the registry service. If you are using the  script, you will need to run the PowerShell session from an elevated prompt. This should not be run on the DVM or HLH.<br>For general guidance on PKI certificate requirements for Azure Stack Hub using public or private/enterprise certificates view this documentation, see [Azure Stack Hub public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate requirements](../../operator/azure-stack-pki-certs.md)<br>The FQDN for the certificate should follow this pattern `<vmname>.<location>.cloudapp.<fqdn>` unless using a custom domain/dns entry for the endpoint. The name should start with a letter and contain at least two letters, only use lowercase letters, and at least three characters long. |
| Service Principle (SPN) | App Registration | To deploy and configure the container registry an Application Registration, also referred to as a Service Principal (SPN), must be created. This SPN is used during configuration of the VM and registry to access Microsoft Azure Key Vault and Storage Account resources created prior to deploying the Marketplace item.<br>The SPN should be created in AAD within the tenant you are logging into in the user portal of Azure Stack Hub. If using AD FS, it will be created within the local directory.<br>For details on how to create an SPN for both AAD and AD FS authentication methods please review [the following guidance](../../operator/azure-stack-create-service-principals.md).<br> **Important**: You will need to save the SPN App ID and Secret for deploying any updates.<br> |
| Registry username and password | Credentials | The open-source docker container registry is deployed and configured with basic authentication enabled. To access the registry using docker commands to push and pull images, a username and password is required. The username and password are securely stored in a Key Vault store.<br>**Important**: You will need to save the Registry Username and Password to sign in to the registry and push/pull images. |
| SSH Public / Private Key | Credentials | To troubleshoot issues with the deployment or runtime issues with the VM, an SSH public key needs to be provided for the deployment and the corresponding private key accessible. It is recommended to use openssh format, ssh-keygen, to generate the private/public key pair as the diagnostic scripts to collect logs require this format.<br>**Important**: You will need to have access to the public and private keys in order to access the deployed VM for troubleshooting. |
| Access to admin and user portals and management endpoints | Connectivity | This guide assumes you are deploying and configuring the registry from a system with connectivity to the Azure Stack Hub system. |

The script `Pre-reqs` creates the other inputs required to deploy the Marketplace item.

## Installation steps

Installation of the Container registry template requires several resources to be created before deployment.

1. Connect to Azure Stack Hub as a user using PowerShell and select a subscription using the cmdlet `Select-AzureRmSubscription â€“Subscription <subscription guid>`. For more information on connecting as a user to Azure Stack Hub PowerShell, see [Connect to Azure Stack with PowerShell as a user](../../user/azure-stack-powershell-configure-user.md).

2. Run `Import-Modules .\\pre-reqs.ps1` to import the modules within the `pre-reqs.ps1` script. The script will create a resource group, storage account, blob container, Key Vault store, assign access permissions to the SPN, and copy certificates and username and password for the registry to Key Vault store.

3. Run the following cmdlet from an elevated prompt using the values for your environment for the parameters:

    ```powershell  
         Set-ContainerRegistryPrerequisites -Location Shanghai `
         -ServicePrincipalId <spn app id> `
         -ResourceGroupName newregreq1 `
         -StorageAccountName newregsa1 `
         -StorageAccountBlobContainer newregct1 `
         -KeyVaultName newregkv1 `
         -CertificateSecretName containersecret2 `
         -CertificateFilePath C:\crinstall\shanghairegcert.pfx `
         -CertificatePassword <cert password> `
         -RegistryUserName admin `
         -RegistryUserPassword <password> 
    ```

    | Parameter | Details |
    | --- | --- |
    | $Location | This is sometimes referred to as the region name. |
    | $ResourceGroupName | Specify the name of the resource group you want the storage Account and Key Vault store to be created. You will specify a different resource group when deploying the Marketplace item. |
    | $StorageAccountName | Specify the name of the storage account to create for the container registry to use when storing images that have been pushed. |
    | $StorageAccountBlobContainer | Specify the name of the blob container to create which is used for image storage. |
    | $KeyVaultName | Specify the name of the Key Vault store to create for storing the certificate and username and password value. |
    | $CertificateSecretName | Provide the name of the secret created in Key Vault to store the PFX certificate. |
    | $CertificateFilePath | Provide the path to the PFX certificate. |
    | $CertificatePassword | Provide the password for the PFX certificate. |
    | $ServicePrincipalId | Provide the AppID of the SPN. |
    | $RegistryUserName | Provide the username for accessing the registry service using basic authorization. |
    | $RegistryUserPassword | Provide the password for the registry user. |

1. Once the script completes, note the end of the script includes parameters to be used in the template deployment. When copying and pasting these values, there may be a space introduced if the value wraps.

2. To test out the registry open a docker CLI instance from a machine / VM with access to the registry URL.

    > [!Note]
    >  If you used a self-signed certificate or certificate not known to the VM you are using to access the registry you will need to install that certificate on the VM and restart Docker.

## Pushing and pulling images from container registry

1. Sign in using `docker login â€“u \<username> -p \<password>`.
2. Pull and image from a known registry.
3. Tag the image to target the newly deployed docker container registry.
4. Push the image to the new target registry.
