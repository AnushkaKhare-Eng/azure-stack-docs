# Generate certificate signing requests for Azure Stack Hub

You use the Azure Stack Hub Readiness Checker tool to create certificate signing requests (CSRs) that are suitable for an Azure Stack Hub deployment. It's important to request, generate, and validate certificates with enough time to test them before they're deployed. 

The tool is used to request the following certificates:

- **Standard certificates**: [Generate certificate signing requests for new deployments](azure-stack-get-pki-certs.md#generate-csrs-for-new-deployments).
- **Renewal certificates**: [Generate certificate signing request for certificate renewal](azure-stack-get-pki-certs.md#generate-csrs-for-certificate-renewal).
- **Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) certificates**: [Azure Stack Hub public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate requirements - optional PaaS certificates](azure-stack-pki-certs.md#optional-paas-certificates).

## Prerequisites

Before you generate CSRs for PKI certificates for an Azure Stack Hub deployment, your system must meet the following prerequisites:

- You must be on a machine with Windows 10 or later, or Windows Server 2016 or later.
- Install the [Azure Stack Hub Readiness checker tool](https://aka.ms/AzsReadinessChecker) from a PowerShell prompt (5.1 or later) using the following cmdlet:
   ```powershell  
       Install-Module Microsoft.AzureStack.ReadinessChecker -Force -AllowPrerelease
   ```
- You'll need the following attributes for your certificate:
  - Region name
  - External fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
  - Subject

> [!NOTE]  
>
> Elevation is required to generate certificate signing requests. In restricted environments where elevation is not possible, you can use this tool to generate clear-text template files, which contain all the information that's required for Azure Stack Hub external certificates. You then need to use these template files on an elevated session to finish the public/private key pair generation.

## Generate CSRs for new deployment certificates

To prepare CSRs for new Azure Stack Hub PKI certificates, complete the following steps:

1. Open a PowerShell session on the machine where you installed the Readiness Checker tool.
1. Declare the following variables:

    ```powershell  
    $outputDirectory = "$ENV:USERPROFILE\Documents\AzureStackCSR" # An existing output directory
    $IdentitySystem = "AAD"                     # Use "AAD" for Azure Active Director, "ADFS" for Active Directory Federation Services
    $regionName = 'east'                        # The region name for your Azure Stack Hub deployment
    $externalFQDN = 'azurestack.contoso.com'    # The external FQDN for your Azure Stack Hub deployment
    ```

    > [!NOTE]  
    > `<regionName>.<externalFQDN>` forms the basis on which all external DNS names in Azure Stack Hub are created. In this example, the portal would be `portal.east.azurestack.contoso.com`.  

Now generate the CSRs. The instructions are specific to the Subject format that you select below:

# [Subject with no CN](#tab/omit-cn)

> [!NOTE]  
> The first DNS name of the Azure Stack Hub service will be configured as the CN field on the certificate request.

1. Declare a subject, for example:

    ```powershell  
    $subject = "C=US,ST=Washington,L=Redmond,O=Microsoft,OU=Azure Stack Hub"
    ```

[!INCLUDE [prepare](../includes/get-pki-certs-csrs.md)]


# [Subject with CN](#tab/add-cn)

> [!NOTE]  
> The CN you specify will be configured on every certificate request. 

1. Declare a subject, for example:

    ```powershell  
    $subject = "C=US,ST=Washington,L=Redmond,O=Microsoft,OU=Azure Stack Hub,CN=portal.domain.com"
    ```

[!INCLUDE [prepare](../includes/get-pki-certs-csrs.md)]

# [Subject with only CN](#tab/only-cn)

> [!NOTE]  
> **Only** the CN you specify will be configured on every certificate request. 

1. Declare a subject, for example:

    ```powershell  
    $subject = "CN=portal.domain.com"
    ```

[!INCLUDE [prepare](../includes/get-pki-certs-csrs-cn-only.md)]

---

Complete the final steps:

1. Review the output:

    ```powershell  
    Starting Certificate Request Process for Deployment
    CSR generating for following SAN(s): *.adminhosting.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.adminvault.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.blob.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.hosting.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.queue.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.table.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.vault.east.azurestack.contoso.com,adminmanagement.east.azurestack.contoso.com,adminportal.east.azurestack.contoso.com,management.east.azurestack.contoso.com,portal.east.azurestack.contoso.com
    Present this CSR to your Certificate Authority for Certificate Generation:  C:\Users\username\Documents\AzureStackCSR\Deployment_east_azurestack_contoso_com_SingleCSR_CertRequest_20200710165538.req
    Certreq.exe output: CertReq: Request Created
    ```

1. Submit the generated .req file to your certificate authority (CA) (either internal or public). The output directory named New-AzsCertificateSigningRequest contains the CSRs that must be submitted to a CA. The directory also contains, for your reference, a child directory containing the .inf files to be used during certificate request generation. Be sure that your CA generates certificates by using a generated request that meets the [Azure Stack Hub PKI requirements](azure-stack-pki-certs.md).

1. If the `-LowPrivilege` parameter was used, an .inf file was generated in the `C:\Users\username\Documents\AzureStackCSR` subdirectory. For example: 

    `C:\Users\username\Documents\AzureStackCSR\Deployment_east_azurestack_contoso_com_SingleCSR_CertRequest_20200710165538_ClearTextTemplate.inf` 

    Copy the file to a system where elevation is allowed, then sign each request with `certreq` by using the following syntax: `certreq -new <example.inf> <example.req>`. Then complete the rest of the process on that elevated system, because it requires matching the new certificate that's signed by the CA with its private key, which is generated on the elevated system.

## Generate CSRs for renewal certificates  

This section covers preparation of CSRs for renewal of existing Azure Stack Hub PKI certificates.

### Before you begin

Your systemâ€™s region and external domain name (FQDN) will be used by the Readiness Checker to determine the endpoint for extracting attributes from your existing certificates. If either of the following apply to your scenario, you must use the **Choose a CSR certificate scenario** selector above and chose the [New deployment](\azure-stack\operator\azure-stack-get-pki-cert?pivots=csr-type-new-deployment) version of this article instead:
   - You want to change the attributes of certificates at the endpoint, such as subject, key length, and signature algorithm.
   - You want to use a certificate subject that contains only the common name attribute.

You must also confirm that you have HTTPS connectivity for your Azure Stack Hub system before beginning.

### Generate CSRs 

1. Declare `stampEndpoint` in the form of `regionname.domain.com` of the Azure Stack Hub system. For example, if the Azure Stack Hub tenant portal address is `https://</code><code>portal.east.azurestack.contoso.com`, run the following:

    ```powershell  
    $stampEndpoint = 'east.azurestack.contoso.com'
    ```

    > [!NOTE]  
    >
    > The Readiness Checker uses `stampEndpoint` (region and domain) to build a pointer to existing certificates that the certificate type requires. For example, for deployment certificates, "portal" is prepended by the tool. So `portal.east.azurestack.contoso.com` is used in certificate cloning, and `sso.appservices.east.azurestack.contoso.com` is used for app services.

1. Declare the path to an existing output directory:

    ```powershell  
    $outputDirectory = "$ENV:USERPROFILE\Documents\AzureStackCSR"
    ```

1. To generate certificate signing requests for deployment, run:

    ```powershell  
    New-AzsHubDeploymentCertificateSigningRequest -StampEndpoint $stampEndpoint -OutputRequestPath $OutputDirectory
    ```

    To generate certificate requests for other Azure Stack Hub services, run:

    ```powershell  
    # App Services
    New-AzsHubAppServicesCertificateSigningRequest -StampEndpoint $stampEndpoint -OutputRequestPath $OutputDirectory

    # DBAdapter
    New-AzsHubDBAdapterCertificateSigningRequest -StampEndpoint $stampEndpoint -OutputRequestPath $OutputDirectory

    # EventHubs
    New-AzsHubEventHubsCertificateSigningRequest -StampEndpoint $stampEndpoint -OutputRequestPath $OutputDirectory
    ```

1. Alternatively, for development and test environments, to generate a single certificate request with multiple-subject alternative names, add the `-RequestType SingleCSR` parameter and value. (We do *not* recommend using this approach for production environments.)

    ```powershell  
    New-AzsHubDeploymentCertificateSigningRequest -StampEndpoint $stampendpoint -OutputRequestPath $OutputDirectory -RequestType SingleCSR
    ```

1. Review the output:

    ```powershell  
    Querying StampEndpoint portal.east.azurestack.contoso.com for existing certificate
    Starting Certificate Request Process for Deployment
    CSR generating for following SAN(s): *.adminhosting.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.adminvault.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.blob.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.hosting.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.queue.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.table.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.vault.east.azurestack.contoso.com,adminmanagement.east.azurestack.contoso.com,adminportal.east.azurestack.contoso.com,management.east.azurestack.contoso.com,portal.east.azurestack.contoso.com
    Present this CSR to your certificate authority for certificate generation: C:\Users\username\Documents\AzureStackCSR\Deployment_east_azurestack_contoso_com_SingleCSR_CertRequest_20200710122723.req
    Certreq.exe output: CertReq: Request Created
    ```

1. Submit the generated .req file to your CA (either internal or public). The output directory named New-AzsCertificateSigningRequest contains the CSRs that must be submitted to a CA. The directory also contains, for your reference, a child directory containing the .inf files to be used during certificate request generation. Be sure that your CA generates certificates by using a generated request that meets the [Azure Stack Hub PKI requirements](azure-stack-pki-certs.md).
