# Deployment overview

To enable replication of virtual machines (VMs) across two Azure Stack Hub environments, you must configure the following environments:

- The **source** environment. This is the Azure Stack Hub environment in which user VMs (the actual workloads you want to protect) are running.
- The **target** environment. This is where the Azure Site Recovery resource provider and dependencies run.

The process to install Azure Site Recovery includes actions from both the Azure Stack Hub operator and the Azure Stack Hub user:

## Operators

Operators must perform the following steps:

- Source: prepare the environment.
  - Download the **Azure Site Recovery appliance on AzureStack Hub** VM image and the respective **Azure Site Recovery â€“ extensions** in the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace Management.
  - Ensure that Azure Stack Hub users can deploy the **ASR appliance on AzureStack Hub** VM image in their respective Azure Stack Hub user subscriptions (where the VM workloads run).
- Target: prepare the environment by installing Site Recovery services and dependencies, ensuring the right quotas are assigned to the respective plans and offers where Site Recovery will be used.

## Users

Users must perform the following steps:

- Source:
  - Deploy the **ASR appliance on AzureStack Hub** VM image in their Azure Stack Hub user subscription.
  - Ensure that their use has owner rights on each Azure Stack Hub user subscription where they will protect VM workloads.
- Target:
  - Deploy the Azure Site Recovery Vault.
  - Create the protection policies and enable the protection of the workloads.

## Next steps
