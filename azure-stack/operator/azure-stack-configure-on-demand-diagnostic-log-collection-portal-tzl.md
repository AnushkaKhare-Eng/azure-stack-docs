# Send Azure Stack Hub diagnostic logs now

Azure Stack operators can send diagnostics logs on-demand to Microsoft Customer Support Services (CSS), before requesting support, by using the Administrator portal or PowerShell. If Azure Stack Hub is connected to the Azure, the **Send logs now** option in the Administrator portal is recommended because it's the simplest way to send the logs directly to Microsoft. If the portal is unavailable, operators should instead [send logs now using Send-AzureStackDiagnosticLog](azure-stack-configure-on-demand-diagnostic-log-collection-powershell-tzl.md). 

If you are disconnected from the internet or want to only save logs locally, use [Get-AzureStackLog](azure-stack-get-azurestacklog.md) method to send logs. The following flowchart shows which option to use for sending diagnostic logs in each case.

>[!NOTE]
>As an alternative to collecting logs on demand, you can streamline the troubleshooting process by [proactively collecting diagnostic logs](azure-stack-configure-automatic-diagnostic-log-collection-tzl.md). If system health conditions need to be investigated, the logs are uploaded automatically for analysis before opening a case with CSS. If proactive log collection is enabled, **Help and Support** shows when log collection is in progress. If you click **Send logs now** to collect logs from a specific time while proactive log collection is in progress, on-demand collection begins after proactive log collection is complete.

Specify the start time and end time for log collection and click **Collect and Upload**.
