# Azure Stack Hub Operator Access Workstation (preview only)

The Operator Access Workstation (OAW) is used to deploy a jump box virtual machine (VM) on the Hardware Lifecycle Host (HLH) so an Azure Stack Hub operator can access the privileged endpoint (PEP) and the Administrator portal for support scenarios. The HLH version must run version 2005 or later. 

The OAW VM should be created when an operator performs a new task. After a required task inside the VM is completed, the VM should be shut down and removed as Azure Stack Hub doesn't need to always run it.  

Due to the stateless nature of the solution, there are no updates for the OAW VM. For each milestone, a new version of the VM image file will be released. Use the latest version to create a new OAW VM. The image file is based on the latest Windows Server 2019 version. After installation, you can apply updates, including any critical updates, using Windows Update. 

Please be sure to review the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) and [Legal Terms](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/azure-stack-hub/azure-stack-operator-access-workstation-legal-terms) prior to download.

To get the files to create the OAW VM for the preview, [**download here**](https://aka.ms/OAWDownload).

The following user account policy is applied to the OAW VM:

- Built-in Administrator username: AdminUser
- MinimumPasswordLength = 14
- PasswordComplexity is enabled
- MinimumPasswordAge = 1 (day)
- MaximumPasswordAge = 42 (days)
- NewGuestName = GUser (disabled by default)

The following table lists the pre-installed software on the OAW VM.

## Check HLH version

1. Log onto the HLH with your credentials.
1. Open PowerShell ISE and run the following script:

   ```powershell
   'C:\Version\Get-Version.ps1'
   ```

   For example:

   ![Screenshot of PowerShell cmdlet to check the version of the OAW VM](./media/operator-access-workstation/check-hardware-lifecycle-host-version.png)

## Create the OAW VM using a script

The following script prepares the virtual machine as the Operator Access Workstation (OAW), which is used to access Microsoft Azure Stack Hub for administration and diagnostics.

1. Log onto the HLH with your credentials.
1. Download OAW.zip and extract the files.
1. Open an elevated PowerShell session.
1. Navigate to the extracted contents of the OAW.zip file.
1. Run the New-OAW.ps1 script. The following two parameter sets are available for New-OAW, with optional parameters shown in brackets:

   ```powershell
   -LocalAdministratorPassword <Security.SecureString> [-AzureStackCertificatePath <String>] [-ERCSVMIP <String[]>] [-DNS <String[]>] [-DeploymentDataFilePath <String>] [-SkipNetworkConfiguration] [-UseDVMConfiguration] [-ImageFilePath <String>] [-VirtualMachineName <String>] [-VirtualMachineMemory <int64>] [-VirtualProcessorCount <int>] [-VirtualMachineDiffDiskPath <String>] [-PhysicalAdapterMACAddress <String>] [-VirtualSwitchName <String>] [-ReCreate] [-AsJob] [-Passthru] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
   ```

   ```powershell
   -LocalAdministratorPassword <Security.SecureString> -IPAddress <String> -SubnetMask <String> -DefaultGateway <String> -DNS <String[]> [-AzureStackCertificatePath <String>] [-ERCSVMIP <String[]>] [-ImageFilePath <String>] [-VirtualMachineName <String>] [-VirtualMachineMemory <int64>] [-VirtualProcessorCount <int>] [-VirtualMachineDiffDiskPath <String>] [-PhysicalAdapterMACAddress <String>] [-VirtualSwitchName <String>] [-ReCreate] [-AsJob] [-Passthru] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
   ```

   For example, to create the OAW VM on the HLH without any customization using Azure Stack Hub version 2005 or later, run the New-OAW.ps1 script with only the **-LocalAdministratorPassword** parameter:

   ```powershell
   $securePassword = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter password for Azure Stack OAW's local administrator" -AsSecureString
   New-OAW.ps1 -LocalAdministratorPassword $securePassword  
   ```

The following table lists the definition for each parameter.

 ### Examples

To create the OAW VM on the HLH without any customization using Azure Stack Hub version 2005 or later, run the New-OAW.ps1 script with the following parameters:

   ```powershell
   $securePassword = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter password for Azure Stack OAW's local administrator" -AsSecureString
   New-OAW.ps1 -LocalAdministratorPassword $securePassword   
   ```

To create the OAW VM on the HLH with DeploymentData.json, run the New-OAW.ps1 script with the following parameters:

   ```powershell
   $securePassword = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter password for Azure Stack OAW's local administrator" -AsSecureString
   New-OAW.ps1 -LocalAdministratorPassword $securePassword `
      -DeploymentDataFilePath 'D:\AzureStack\DeploymentData.json'
   ```

To create the OAW VM on a host with network connection to Azure Stack Hub, run the New-OAW.ps1 script with the following parameters:

   ```powershell
   $securePassword = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter password for Azure Stack OAW's local administrator" -AsSecureString
   New-OAW.ps1 -LocalAdministratorPassword $securePassword `
      -IPAddress '192.168.0.20' `
      -SubnetMask '255.255.255.0' `
      -DefaultGateway '192.168.0.1' `
      -DNS '192.168.0.10'
   ```

## Check the OAW VM version

1. Log onto the OAW VM with your credentials.
1. Open PowerShell ISE and run the following script:

   ```powershell
   'C:\Version\Get-Version.ps1'
   ```

   For example:

   ![Screenshot of PowerShell cmdlet to check the Hardware LifeCycle Host version](./media/operator-access-workstation/check-operator-access-workstation-vm-version.png)


## Remove the OAW VM

The following script removes the OAW VM, which is used to access Azure Stack Hub for administration and diagnostics. This script also removes the disk files and the guardian associated with the VM.

1. Log onto the HLH with your credentials.
1. Open an elevated PowerShell session. 
1. Navigate to the extracted contents of the installed OAW.zip file.
1. Remove the VM by running the Remove-OAW.ps1 script: 

   ```powershell
   Remove-OAW.ps1 -VirtualMachineName <name>
   ```

   Where \<name\> is the name of the virtual machine to be removed. By default, the name is **AzSOAW**.

   For example:

   ```powershell
   Remove-OAW.ps1 -VirtualMachineName AzSOAW
   ```
