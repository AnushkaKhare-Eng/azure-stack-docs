# How to manage IoT Hub on Azure Stack Hub

The IoT Hub management experience allows you to visualize and manage overall status, alerts, and capacity.

## IoT Hub management dashboard

To access the IoT Hub management dashboard:

1. Sign in to the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal, select the **Dashboard** view on the left, then select the **IoT Hub** resource provider:

2. The IoT Hub dashboard provides a summary view, showing current alerts, quotas created on the stamp, and the total number of IoT Hub clusters in your subscription:

## Alerts

The IoT Hub resource provider supports the following alerts:

|Category|Alert|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|Performance|IoT Hub CPU usage needs attention.|Warning|The average of % CPU usage of IoT Hub resource provider in the last 6 hours is over 75%.|
|Performance|IoT Hub memory usage needs attention.|Warning|The remaining memory usage of IoT Hub resource provider in the last 6 hours is less than 1024 MB.|
|Performance|Low disk space for IoT Hub resource provider.|Warning|The remaining disk space is less than 10%.|
|Resource|Creating or updating IoT Hub resource failed.|Warning|IoT Hub Resource Provider Create or Update IoT Hub Failure Count is no less than 1 in 15 minutes.|
|Service|IoT Hub resource provider log errors needs attention.|Warning|IoT Hub resource provider log failure count per role instance is more than 3 in 15 minutes.|
|Service|IoTHub-SU-InternalError|Warning|IoTHub SU Internal Failure and Timeout Count is no less than 5 in the last 30 minutes.|
|Service|IoT Hub data plane backup failure occurred.|Warning|IoT Hub data plane had backup failures during the past 15 minutes. Device data will not be protected.|
|Service|IoT Hub data plane consecutive backup failure has occurred.|Warning|IoT Hub data plane had consecutive backup failures during the past 15 minutes. Device data will not be protected.|
|Service|IoT Hub data plane no success backup failure occurred.|Warning|IoT Hub has no successful backup in last 3 hours. Your device data may not be protected.|
|Service|IoT Hub data plane restore failed.|Warning|IoT Hub device information restore failed. IotHubPerformanceMetrics exceeds threshold for the past 15 minutes.|
|Service|IoT Hub gateway failure occurred.|Warning|IoT Hub gateway failure occurred. Device telemetry functionality may be impacted.|
|Service|IoT Hub Container failure occurred.|Warning|IoT Hub container failure has occurred. Device authentication may fail. |
|Service|IoT Hub device management container failure occurred.|Warning|IoT Hub device management container failure has occurred. Device twin, direct method functionalities may be degraded.|

To monitor alerts and quotas:

1. Select **Alerts** to view the alert history:

2. Select **Quotas** to see the list of quotas in effect:  

   > [!NOTE]
   > During preview, the **Create** feature is disabled and an unlimited default quota is provided. **Create** will be enabled for GA.

## Capacity management

As an operator, you manage and operate your Azure Stack Hub instance in the same manner as any cloud operator. You make sure software is installed properly, configured correctly and securely, and operated for high availability (HA), coherently and efficiently. You'll need to apply capacity management principles in operating both the Azure Stack Hub instance and the IoT Hub resource provider.

### Azure Stack Hub capacity management

To determine the required capacity for IoT Hub, you'll need to estimate the workload, mainly the number of devices and the message throughput. To assist with planning, we have conducted the following tests on a 4-node Azure Stack Hub environment for reference:

| Scenario | VMs | Vcores | Devices/ hub | [Hub edition](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub) | Hubs | Units/ hub | Total devices | Total hub units | Millions of messages/ day |
|----------|---------------|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-|-|-|-|-|
|Default|5|20|300,000|S2|4|200|1,200,000|800|4,800|
|12 VMs|12|48|500,000|S2|4|200|2,000,000|800|4,800|
|18 VMs|18|72|400,000|S3|4|10|1,600,000|40|12,000|

Refer to [Azure Stack Hub Capacity Planner](azure-stack-capacity-planner.md) for more details.

### IoT Hub capacity management

Because Azure Stack Hub is deployed in an on-premises data center with limited resources, all services running on Azure Stack Hub share and compete for the same resource pool. Operators need to plan and manage the capacity based on the business needs. The IoT Hub resource provider gives operators the ability to manage the capacity requirements for the service.

IoT Hub has a single VM type. As part of IoT Hub deployment, the system provisions a set of these VMs on Azure Stack Hub. The VMs can support a certain number of devices and message throughput. The default setting should meet most requirements. However, if you need more devices or higher message throughput, you can increase the capacity using the administrator portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell. 

To monitor and change capacity settings:

1. Select the **Capacity** view on the left. You'll see capacity status, including the number of VMs provisioned in an IoT Hub cluster and their resource utilization. The number of nodes shown is the current number of nodes allocated to IoT Hub. 

2. To increase capacity, select the IoT Hub cluster name, change the number of nodes, then select **Update Scale**. You can increase capacity by adding as many VMs as available resources allow.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Only IoT Hub cluster scale-out (smaller-to-larger) is supported for preview. Scale-in (larger-to-smaller) will be supported in the General Availability (GA) version of IoT Hub.
