# How to install Event Hubs on Azure Stack Hub

This article shows you how to download and install the Event Hubs resource provider, making it available to offer to customers for subscription.

## Download packages

Before you can install Event Hubs on Azure Stack Hub, you must download the resource provider and its dependent packages using the Marketplace Management feature. If you're not familiar with Marketplace Management, spend time reviewing [Download marketplace items from Azure and publish to Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-download-azure-marketplace-item.md). This section walks you through the process of downloading items from the Azure marketplace. 

> [!NOTE]
> The download process can take 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the network latency and existing packages on your Azure Stack Hub instance.

For a connected scenario, you download the items from the Azure marketplace directly to the Azure Stack Hub marketplace:

1. Sign in to the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal.
2. Select **Marketplace Management** on the left.
3. Select **Resource providers**.
4. Select **+ Add from Azure**.
5. Search for "Event Hubs" using the search bar.
6. Select the "Event Hubs" row on the search results. 
7. On the "Event Hubs" download page, select the Event Hubs version you wish to install, then select **Download** at the bottom of the page.

For a disconnected or partially connected scenario, you download the packages to your local machine then import them into your Azure Stack Hub marketplace:

1. If you haven't already, follow the instructions in [Download Marketplace items - Disconnected or partially connected scenarios](azure-stack-download-azure-marketplace-item.md?pivots=state-disconnected). Here you download and run the Marketplace Syndication tool, which allows you to download the Event Hubs packages.
2. After the syndication tool's "Azure Marketplace Items" window opens, find and select "Event Hubs" to download the required packages to your local machine.
3. Once the download finishes, you import the packages to your Azure Stack Hub instance and publish to Marketplace. 
::: zone-end

## Next steps

Before users can deploy Event Hubs resources, you must create one or more plans, offers, and subscriptions. 

- If this is the first time you're offering a service, start with the [Offer services to users](tutorial-offer-services.md) tutorial. Then continue with the next tutorial, [Test a service offering](tutorial-test-offer.md).
- Once you're familiar with the concept of offering a service, create an offer and plan that includes the Event Hubs resource provider. Then create a subscription for your users, or give them the offer information so they can create their own. For reference, you can also follow the series of articles under the [Service, plan, offer, subscription overview](service-plan-offer-subscription-overview.md).
