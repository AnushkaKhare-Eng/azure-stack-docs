# Offer a Red Hat-based virtual machine for Azure Stack Hub

This article describes how to prepare a Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine (VM) for use in Azure Stack Hub. 

## Offer a Red Hat-based VM

There are two ways that you can offer Red Hat-based VM in Azure Stack Hub:

- You can add offer the machine through the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace.
    - Get familiar with the [Red Hat Cloud Access program](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/cloud-access) terms. Enable your Red Hat subscriptions for Cloud Access at [Red Hat Subscription-Manager](https://access.redhat.com/management/cloud). You need to have on hand the Azure subscriptions that your Azure Stack Hub is registered with to be registered for Cloud Access.
    - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Images are a private offering on Azure Stack Hub. To make this offering available to your **Marketplace Management** tab, you will need to [complete a survey](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR_e32WQju3tMrgXNcUR94AVUNkJTWjdQRjc3TzFLREdGU0dIVFRUQ1JCSi4u). After you post the survey, it will take seven business days to see it in your **Add from Azure** tab within Marketplace Management.
    - For more information, see [Azure Stack Hub Marketplace overview](azure-stack-marketplace.md).
- You can add your own custom to your Azure Stack Hub and then offer the image in the Marketplace. 
    1. You will need to have Red Hat cloud access.
    2. For instructions on preparing the image for Azure and Azure Stack Hub, see [Prepare a Red Hat-based virtual machine for Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/redhat-create-upload-vhd).
    3. For instructions on offering your custom image in the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace, see [Create and publish a Marketplace item](azure-stack-create-and-publish-marketplace-item.md).
